How many Earth days equal one Mercury day at the equator?,"Because of the slow spin, one full day-night cycle is 176 Earth days."
Is Mercury a rocky planet or a gas planet?,"Mercury is a rocky (terrestrial) planet, like Earth, Venus, and Mars."
What would happen if you dropped a feather and a hammer on Mercury?,They would hit the ground at the same time (just like on the Moon) because there’s almost no air.
What is Mercury?,Mercury is the smallest planet in our Solar System and the closest planet to the Sun.
How far is Mercury from the Sun?,Mercury is about 58 million kilometers (36 million miles) from the Sun on average – much closer than Earth!
Why is Mercury the closest planet to the Sun?,It formed that way billions of years ago when the Solar System was born – it just happened to be the nearest one.
How big is Mercury compared to Earth?,"Mercury is much smaller – if Earth were the size of a basketball, Mercury would be like a tennis ball."
Does Mercury have any moons?,"No, Mercury has zero moons."
What is the surface of Mercury like?,"It’s rocky, gray, and covered in thousands of craters from asteroid hits, just like our Moon."
Why does Mercury have so many craters?,"It has almost no air or atmosphere to burn up space rocks, so they crash right into it."
How hot does Mercury get during the day?,It can reach over 400°C – hotter than an oven!
Why is Mercury so hot?,It’s very close to the Sun and the sunlight is super strong there.
How cold does Mercury get at night?,It can drop to -170°C – colder than a freezer!
Why does Mercury get so cold at night?,"It has almost no atmosphere to trap the heat, so all the warmth escapes into space."
How long is one day on Mercury?,One day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days – that’s a very long school day!
How long is one year on Mercury?,A year on Mercury is only 88 Earth days because it zooms around the Sun so fast.
Does Mercury have an atmosphere?,It has a very thin layer of gas called an exosphere – it’s almost like having no air at all.
Why can’t people breathe on Mercury?,"There’s almost no oxygen and the air is way too thin, hot, and full of radiation."
What color is Mercury?,"Mercury looks gray and rocky, a bit like the Moon."
Who was Mercury named after?,It was named after the speedy messenger of the Roman gods because it moves so fast across the sky.
Can we see Mercury from Earth without a telescope?,Yes! It’s sometimes visible just after sunset or before sunrise – it’s called the “evening star” or “morning star.”
What spacecraft have visited Mercury?,Two spacecraft: Mariner 10 in the 1970s and MESSENGER from 2004–2015.
What did MESSENGER discover?,"It found ice in deep craters near the poles that never see sunlight, even though Mercury is super hot!"
Is there ice on Mercury?,"Yes, hidden in shadowy craters at the north and south poles where the Sun never shines."
Why doesn’t the ice melt on Mercury?,"Those craters are always in shadow and super cold, and there’s no air to carry heat to them."
How fast does Mercury travel around the Sun?,It zooms at about 47 kilometers per second (29 miles per second) – the fastest planet!
Does Mercury have rings like Saturn?,"No, Mercury has no rings at all."
What is the biggest crater on Mercury?,It’s the Caloris Basin – so huge you could fit the whole state of Texas inside it!
Why is Mercury’s sky black even in daytime?,"It has almost no atmosphere to scatter sunlight, so the sky stays black and you can see stars during the day."
Can people ever live on Mercury?,"Probably not – it’s too hot, too cold, no air, and too much radiation from the Sun."
How many times could Mercury fit inside Earth?,About 18 Mercurys could fit inside Earth.
What is Mercury mostly made of?,It has a huge iron core (almost 75% of the planet) covered by a thin rocky layer.
Why does Mercury have such a big iron core?,"Scientists think a giant crash long ago knocked away most of the rocky outside, leaving the heavy iron."
Is Mercury shrinking?,"Yes! It’s slowly cooling inside and shrinking a tiny bit, making wrinkle-like cliffs."
What are those wrinkle cliffs called?,They’re called “scarps” or “lobate scarps.”
How long would it take to drive around Mercury in a car?,"If you drove 100 km/h without stopping, it would take about 60 Earth days to go all the way around."
Can you explain why Mercury has no seasons?,"Actually, Mercury has almost no tilt, so it doesn’t really have seasons like Earth."
Where is the hottest place on Mercury?,Right at the point facing the Sun at noon – it can get hotter than 430°C!
Where is the coldest place on Mercury?,In the bottoms of polar craters that never see sunlight.
Why does the Sun look bigger from Mercury?,"Because Mercury is closer to the Sun, the Sun appears almost three times bigger than from Earth."
What is Mercury’s gravity like compared to Earth?,It’s only about 38% of Earth’s gravity – you would weigh much less and could jump really high!
How many people have walked on Mercury?,Zero – no human has ever been there; only robots!
What is the brightest planet we see from Earth?,"Venus is usually brighter, but Mercury can look very bright when conditions are right."
Can you see Mercury during the day?,Very rarely and only with a telescope because the Sun is too bright.
Why does Mercury always show the same side to the Sun sometimes?,"Actually, it spins 3 times for every 2 orbits, so different parts get sunlight."
What is a transit of Mercury?,When Mercury passes directly between Earth and the Sun – it looks like a tiny black dot crossing the Sun.
How often do we study Mercury today?,Scientists use telescopes on Earth and data from the old MESSENGER mission.
Will we send another spacecraft to Mercury?,Yes! A mission called BepiColombo (from Europe and Japan) is on its way and will arrive in 2025–2026.
What is special about Mercury’s orbit?,It’s the most oval (elliptical) orbit of any planet except Pluto.

What is the surface of Mercury like?,"It’s rocky, gray, and covered in thousands of craters from asteroid hits, just like our Moon."
Why does Mercury have so many craters?,"It has almost no air or atmosphere to burn up space rocks, so they crash right into it."
How hot does Mercury get during the day?,It can reach over 400°C (800°F) – hotter than an oven!
Why is Mercury so hot?,It’s very close to the Sun and the sunlight is super strong there.
How cold does Mercury get at night?,It can drop to -170°C (-280°F) – colder than a freezer!
Why does Mercury get so cold at night?,"It has almost no atmosphere to trap the heat, so all the warmth escapes into space."
How long is one day on Mercury?,One day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days – that’s a very long school day!
How long is one year on Mercury?,A year on Mercury is only 88 Earth days because it zooms around the Sun so fast.
Does Mercury have an atmosphere?,It has a very thin layer of gas called an exosphere – it’s almost like having no air at all.
Why can’t people breathe on Mercury?,"There’s almost no oxygen and the air is way too thin, hot, and full of radiation."
What color is Mercury?,"Mercury looks gray and rocky, a bit like the Moon."
Who was Mercury named after?,It was named after the speedy messenger of the Roman gods because it moves so fast across the sky.
Can we see Mercury from Earth without a telescope?,Yes! It’s sometimes visible just after sunset or before sunrise – it’s called the “evening star” or “morning star.”
What spacecraft have visited Mercury?,Two spacecraft: Mariner 10 in the 1970s and MESSENGER from 2004–2015.
What did MESSENGER discover?,"It found ice in deep craters near the poles that never see sunlight, even though Mercury is super hot!"
Is there ice on Mercury?,"Yes, hidden in shadowy craters at the north and south poles where the Sun never shines."
Why doesn’t the ice melt on Mercury?,"Those craters are always in shadow and super cold, and there’s no air to carry heat to them."
How fast does Mercury travel around the Sun?,It zooms at about 47 kilometers per second (29 miles per second) – the fastest planet!
Does Mercury have rings like Saturn?,"No, Mercury has no rings at all."
What is the biggest crater on Mercury?,It’s the Caloris Basin – so huge you could fit the whole state of Texas inside it!
Why is Mercury’s sky black even in daytime?,"It has almost no atmosphere to scatter sunlight, so the sky stays black and you can see stars during the day."
Can people ever live on Mercury?,"Probably not – it’s too hot, too cold, no air, and too much radiation from the Sun."
How many times could Mercury fit inside Earth?,About 18 Mercurys could fit inside Earth.
What is Mercury mostly made of?,It has a huge iron core (almost 75% of the planet) covered by a thin rocky layer.
Why does Mercury have such a big iron core?,"Scientists think a giant crash long ago knocked away most of the rocky outside, leaving the heavy iron."
Is Mercury shrinking?,"Yes! It’s slowly cooling inside and shrinking a tiny bit, making wrinkle-like cliffs."
What are those wrinkle cliffs called?,They’re called “scarps” or “lobate scarps.”
How long would it take to drive around Mercury in a car?,"If you drove 100 km/h without stopping, it would take about 60 Earth days to go all the way around."
Can you explain why Mercury has no seasons?,"Actually, Mercury has almost no tilt, so it doesn’t really have seasons like Earth."
Where is the hottest place on Mercury?,Right at the point facing the Sun at noon – it can get hotter than 430°C!
Where is the coldest place on Mercury?,In the bottoms of polar craters that never see sunlight.
Why does the Sun look bigger from Mercury?,"Because Mercury is closer to the Sun, the Sun appears almost three times bigger than from Earth."
What is Mercury’s gravity like compared to Earth?,It’s only about 38% of Earth’s gravity – you would weigh much less and could jump really high!
How many people have walked on Mercury?,Zero – no human has ever been there; only robots!
What is the brightest planet we see from Earth?,"Venus is usually brighter, but Mercury can look very bright when conditions are right."
Can you see Mercury during the day?,Very rarely and only with a telescope because the Sun is too bright.
Why does Mercury always show the same side to the Sun sometimes?,"Actually, it spins 3 times for every 2 orbits, so different parts get sunlight."
What is a transit of Mercury?,When Mercury passes directly between Earth and the Sun – it looks like a tiny black dot crossing the Sun.
How often do we study Mercury today?,Scientists use telescopes on Earth and data from the old MESSENGER mission.
Will we send another spacecraft to Mercury?,Yes! A mission called BepiColombo (from Europe and Japan) is on its way and will arrive in 2025–2026.
What is special about Mercury’s orbit?,It’s the most oval (elliptical) orbit of any planet except Pluto.
Why is it hard to send spacecraft to Mercury?,"The Sun’s gravity is so strong that spacecraft have to slow down a lot, which takes many fly-bys."
How many Earth days equal one Mercury day at the equator?,"Because of the slow spin, one full day-night cycle is 176 Earth days."
Is Mercury a rocky planet or a gas planet?,"Mercury is a rocky (terrestrial) planet, like Earth, Venus, and Mars."
What would happen if you dropped a feather and a hammer on Mercury?,They would hit the ground at the same time (just like on the Moon) because there’s almost no air.
What is Mercury?,Mercury is the smallest planet in our Solar System and the closest planet to the Sun.
How far is Mercury from the Sun?,Mercury is about 58 million kilometers (36 million miles) from the Sun on average – much closer than Earth!
Why is Mercury the closest planet to the Sun?,It formed that way billions of years ago when the Solar System was born – it just happened to be the nearest one.
How big is Mercury compared to Earth?,"Mercury is much smaller – if Earth were the size of a basketball, Mercury would be like a tennis ball."

What is Venus?,Venus is the second planet from the Sun and the hottest planet in our Solar System.
Is Venus bigger or smaller than Earth?,Venus is almost the same size as Earth – it’s like Earth’s twin sister!
Why do we call Venus Earth’s twin?,"Because it’s almost the same size and made of rock, but it’s way too hot to live on."
How far is Venus from the Sun?,Venus is about 108 million kilometers (67 million miles) from the Sun.
How hot is Venus?,It’s over 460°C (860°F) all the time – hot enough to melt lead!
Why is Venus the hottest planet?,It has a super thick blanket of carbon dioxide gas that traps heat like a giant greenhouse.
What is the greenhouse effect on Venus?,"The thick atmosphere traps the Sun’s heat so it can’t escape, making the planet super toasty."
Does Venus have any moons?,"No, Venus has zero moons."
How long is one day on Venus?,One day on Venus (sunrise to sunrise) lasts 243 Earth days – longer than its year!
How long is a year on Venus?,A year on Venus is 225 Earth days – shorter than on Earth.
Why does Venus spin backwards?,Venus spins the opposite way from most planets – on Venus the Sun rises in the west!
What color is Venus in the sky?,Venus is bright white-yellow and is the brightest thing in the sky after the Sun and Moon.
Why is Venus so bright from Earth?,"It’s covered in thick white clouds that reflect sunlight really well, and it comes quite close to Earth."
Can we see Venus without a telescope?,Yes! It’s often called the Evening Star or Morning Star because it shines so brightly.
What are the clouds on Venus made of?,"They’re made of sulfuric acid – like nasty, poisonous rain that never reaches the ground."
Does it rain on Venus?,"Yes, but the rain is sulfuric acid and it evaporates before hitting the ground."
What is the surface of Venus like?,"It’s rocky with thousands of volcanoes, huge lava plains, and mountains."
Are there active volcanoes on Venus?,Scientists think some might still be active – Venus is a very volcanic world!
How thick is Venus’s atmosphere?,It’s about 90 times thicker than Earth’s – it would crush you like the bottom of the ocean.
Can humans breathe on Venus?,No way! The air is mostly carbon dioxide and full of poisonous gases.
Who was Venus named after?,Venus was named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty because it looks so pretty in the sky.
How many spacecraft have landed on Venus?,Only Soviet spacecraft have landed – the Venera probes – and they melted quickly!
How long did the longest Venus lander survive?,The record is about 2 hours before the heat and pressure destroyed it.
Is there lightning on Venus?,Yes! Scientists have seen huge lightning storms in the thick clouds.
Why does Venus have almost no water?,The extreme heat long ago boiled all the water away into space.
Does Venus have craters?,Not many – lava from volcanoes covered most old craters.
What is the highest mountain on Venus?,Maxwell Montes – it’s taller than Mount Everest!
How strong is the wind on Venus?,"Near the ground it’s slow, but high in the clouds it blows over 350 km/h – faster than a hurricane!"
What is super-rotation on Venus?,The clouds go all the way around the planet in just 4 Earth days even though the planet spins slowly.

Will we go back to Venus soon?,Yes! NASA and Europe are planning new missions like VERITAS and EnVision for the 2030s.
What is special about Venus’s day being longer than its year?,It’s the only planet where a day lasts longer than a year – very strange!
Why is Venus sometimes called Earth’s evil twin?,Because it’s almost the same size but turned into a deadly hot hell instead of a nice home.
What is Venus?,Venus is the second planet from the Sun and the hottest planet in our Solar System.
Is Venus bigger or smaller than Earth?,Venus is almost the same size as Earth – it’s like Earth’s twin sister!
Why do we call Venus Earth’s twin?,"Because it’s almost the same size and made of rock, but it’s way too hot to live on."
How far is Venus from the Sun?,Venus is about 108 million kilometers (67 million miles) from the Sun.
How hot is Venus?,It’s over 460°C (860°F) all the time – hot enough to melt lead!
Why is Venus the hottest planet?,It has a super thick blanket of carbon dioxide gas that traps heat like a giant greenhouse.
What is the greenhouse effect on Venus?,"The thick atmosphere traps the Sun’s heat so it can’t escape, making the planet super toasty."
Does Venus have any moons?,"No, Venus has zero moons."
How long is one day on Venus?,One day on Venus (sunrise to sunrise) lasts 243 Earth days – longer than its year!
How long is a year on Venus?,A year on Venus is 225 Earth days – shorter than on Earth.

Why does Mercury get so cold at night?,"It has almost no atmosphere to trap the heat, so all the warmth escapes into space."
How long is one day on Mercury?,One day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days – that’s a very long school day!
How long is one year on Mercury?,A year on Mercury is only 88 Earth days because it zooms around the Sun so fast.
Does Mercury have an atmosphere?,It has a very thin layer of gas called an exosphere – it’s almost like having no air at all.
Why can’t people breathe on Mercury?,"There’s almost no oxygen and the air is way too thin, hot, and full of radiation."
What color is Mercury?,"Mercury looks gray and rocky, a bit like the Moon."
Who was Mercury named after?,It was named after the speedy messenger of the Roman gods because it moves so fast across the sky.
Can we see Mercury from Earth without a telescope?,Yes! It’s sometimes visible just after sunset or before sunrise – it’s called the “evening star” or “morning star.”
What spacecraft have visited Mercury?,Two spacecraft: Mariner 10 in the 1970s and MESSENGER from 2004–2015.
What did MESSENGER discover?,"It found ice in deep craters near the poles that never see sunlight, even though Mercury is super hot!"
Is there ice on Mercury?,"Yes, hidden in shadowy craters at the north and south poles where the Sun never shines."
Why doesn’t the ice melt on Mercury?,"Those craters are always in shadow and super cold, and there’s no air to carry heat to them."
How fast does Mercury travel around the Sun?,It zooms at about 47 kilometers per second (29 miles per second) – the fastest planet!

How many times could Mercury fit inside Earth?,About 18 Mercurys could fit inside Earth.
What's Mercury mostly made of?,It has a huge iron core (almost 75% of the planet) covered by a thin rocky layer.
Why does Mercury have such a big iron core?,"Scientists think a giant crash long ago knocked away most of the rocky outside, leaving the heavy iron."
Is Mercury shrinking?,"Yes! It’s slowly cooling inside and shrinking a tiny bit, making wrinkle-like cliffs."
What are those wrinkle cliffs called?,They’re called “scarps” or “lobate scarps.”
How long would it take to drive around Mercury in a car?,"If you drove 100 km/h without stopping, it would take about 60 Earth days to go all the way around."
Can you explain why Mercury has no seasons?,"Actually, Mercury has almost no tilt, so it doesn’t really have seasons like Earth."
Where's the hottest place on Mercury?,Right at the point facing the Sun at noon – it can get hotter than 430°C!
Where's the coldest place on Mercury?,In the bottoms of polar craters that never see sunlight.
Why does the Sun look bigger from Mercury?,"Because Mercury is closer to the Sun, the Sun appears almost three times bigger than from Earth."
What's Mercury’s gravity like compared to Earth?,It’s only about 38% of Earth’s gravity – you would weigh much less and could jump really high!
How many people have walked on Mercury?,Zero – no human has ever been there; only robots!
What's the brightest planet we see from Earth?,"Venus is usually brighter, but Mercury can look very bright when conditions are right."
Can you see Mercury during the day?,Very rarely and only with a telescope because the Sun is too bright.
Why does Mercury always show the same side to the Sun sometimes?,"Actually, it spins 3 times for every 2 orbits, so different parts get sunlight."
What's a transit of Mercury?,When Mercury passes directly between Earth and the Sun – it looks like a tiny black dot crossing the Sun.
How often do we study Mercury today?,Scientists use telescopes on Earth and data from the old MESSENGER mission.
Will we send another spacecraft to Mercury?,Yes! A mission called BepiColombo (from Europe and Japan) is on its way and will arrive in 2025–2026.
What's special about Mercury’s orbit?,It’s the most oval (elliptical) orbit of any planet except Pluto.
Why's it hard to send spacecraft to Mercury?,"The Sun’s gravity is so strong that spacecraft have to slow down a lot, which takes many fly-bys."
How many Earth days equal one Mercury day at the equator?,"Because of the slow spin, one full day-night cycle is 176 Earth days."
Is Mercury a rocky planet or a gas planet?,"Mercury is a rocky (terrestrial) planet, like Earth, Venus, and Mars."
What would happen if you dropped a feather and a hammer on Mercury?,They would hit the ground at the same time (just like on the Moon) because there’s almost no air.
What's Mercury?,Mercury is the smallest planet in our Solar System and the closest planet to the Sun.
How far is Mercury from the Sun?,Mercury is about 58 million kilometers (36 million miles) from the Sun on average – much closer than Earth!
Why's Mercury the closest planet to the Sun?,It formed that way billions of years ago when the Solar System was born – it just happened to be the nearest one.

Can you see Mercury during the day?,Very rarely and only with a telescope because the Sun is too bright.
Why does Mercury always show the same side to the Sun sometimes?,"Actually, it spins 3 times for every 2 orbits, so different parts get sunlight."
What's a transit of Mercury?,When Mercury passes directly between Earth and the Sun – it looks like a tiny black dot crossing the Sun.
How often do we study Mercury today?,Scientists use telescopes on Earth and data from the old MESSENGER mission.
Will we send another spacecraft to Mercury?,Yes! A mission called BepiColombo (from Europe and Japan) is on its way and will arrive in 2025–2026.
What's special about Mercury’s orbit?,It’s the most oval (elliptical) orbit of any planet except Pluto.
Why's it hard to send spacecraft to Mercury?,"The Sun’s gravity is so strong that spacecraft have to slow down a lot, which takes many fly-bys."
How many Earth days equal one Mercury day at the equator?,"Because of the slow spin, one full day-night cycle is 176 Earth days."
Is Mercury a rocky planet or a gas planet?,"Mercury is a rocky (terrestrial) planet, like Earth, Venus, and Mars."
What would happen if you dropped a feather and a hammer on Mercury?,They would hit the ground at the same time (just like on the Moon) because there’s almost no air.
What's Mercury?,Mercury is the smallest planet in our Solar System and the closest planet to the Sun.
How far is Mercury from the Sun?,Mercury is about 58 million kilometers (36 million miles) from the Sun on average – much closer than Earth!
Why's Mercury the closest planet to the Sun?,It formed that way billions of years ago when the Solar System was born – it just happened to be the nearest one.
How big is Mercury compared to Earth?,"Mercury is much smaller – if Earth were the size of a basketball, Mercury would be like a tennis ball."
Does Mercury have any moons?,"No, Mercury has zero moons."
What's the surface of Mercury like?,"It’s rocky, gray, and covered in thousands of craters from asteroid hits, just like our Moon."
Why does Mercury have so many craters?,"It has almost no air or atmosphere to burn up space rocks, so they crash right into it."
How hot does Mercury get during the day?,It can reach over 400°C (800°F) – hotter than an oven!
Why's Mercury so hot?,It’s very close to the Sun and the sunlight is super strong there.
How cold does Mercury get at night?,It can drop to -170°C (-280°F) – colder than a freezer!
Why does Mercury get so cold at night?,"It has almost no atmosphere to trap the heat, so all the warmth escapes into space."
How long is one day on Mercury?,One day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days – that’s a very long school day!
How long is one year on Mercury?,A year on Mercury is only 88 Earth days because it zooms around the Sun so fast.
Does Mercury have an atmosphere?,It has a very thin layer of gas called an exosphere – it’s almost like having no air at all.
Why can’t people breathe on Mercury?,"There’s almost no oxygen and the air is way too thin, hot, and full of radiation."
What color is Mercury?,"Mercury looks gray and rocky, a bit like the Moon."
Who was Mercury named after?,It was named after the speedy messenger of the Roman gods because it moves so fast across the sky.
Can we see Mercury from Earth without a telescope?,Yes! It’s sometimes visible just after sunset or before sunrise – it’s called the “evening star” or “morning star.”
What spacecraft have visited Mercury?,Two spacecraft: Mariner 10 in the 1970s and MESSENGER from 2004–2015.
What did MESSENGER discover?,"It found ice in deep craters near the poles that never see sunlight, even though Mercury is super hot!"
Is there ice on Mercury?,"Yes, hidden in shadowy craters at the north and south poles where the Sun never shines."
Why doesn’t the ice melt on Mercury?,"Those craters are always in shadow and super cold, and there’s no air to carry heat to them."
How fast does Mercury travel around the Sun?,It zooms at about 47 kilometers per second (29 miles per second) – the fastest planet!
Does Mercury have rings like Saturn?,"No, Mercury has no rings at all."
What's the biggest crater on Mercury?,It’s the Caloris Basin – so huge you could fit the whole state of Texas inside it!
Why's Mercury’s sky black even in daytime?,"It has almost no atmosphere to scatter sunlight, so the sky stays black and you can see stars during the day."
Can people ever live on Mercury?,"Probably not – it’s too hot, too cold, no air, and too much radiation from the Sun."
How many times could Mercury fit inside Earth?,About 18 Mercurys could fit inside Earth.
What's Mercury mostly made of?,It has a huge iron core (almost 75% of the planet) covered by a thin rocky layer.
Why does Mercury have such a big iron core?,"Scientists think a giant crash long ago knocked away most of the rocky outside, leaving the heavy iron."
Is Mercury shrinking?,"Yes! It’s slowly cooling inside and shrinking a tiny bit, making wrinkle-like cliffs."
What are those wrinkle cliffs called?,They’re called “scarps” or “lobate scarps.”
How long would it take to drive around Mercury in a car?,"If you drove 100 km/h without stopping, it would take about 60 Earth days to go all the way around."
Can you explain why Mercury has no seasons?,"Actually, Mercury has almost no tilt, so it doesn’t really have seasons like Earth."
Where's the hottest place on Mercury?,Right at the point facing the Sun at noon – it can get hotter than 430°C!
Where's the coldest place on Mercury?,In the bottoms of polar craters that never see sunlight.
Why does the Sun look bigger from Mercury?,"Because Mercury is closer to the Sun, the Sun appears almost three times bigger than from Earth."
What's Mercury’s gravity like compared to Earth?,It’s only about 38% of Earth’s gravity – you would weigh much less and could jump really high!
How many people have walked on Mercury?,Zero – no human has ever been there; only robots!
What's the brightest planet we see from Earth?,"Venus is usually brighter, but Mercury can look very bright when conditions are right."

Why's it hard to send spacecraft to Mercury?,"The Sun’s gravity is so strong that spacecraft have to slow down a lot, which takes many fly-bys."
How many Earth days equal one Mercury day at the equator?,"Because of the slow spin, one full day-night cycle is 176 Earth days."
Is Mercury a rocky planet or a gas planet?,"Mercury is a rocky (terrestrial) planet, like Earth, Venus, and Mars."
What would happen if you dropped a feather and a hammer on Mercury?,They would hit the ground at the same time (just like on the Moon) because there’s almost no air.
What's Mercury?,Mercury is the smallest planet in our Solar System and the closest planet to the Sun.
How far is Mercury from the Sun?,Mercury is about 58 million kilometers (36 million miles) from the Sun on average – much closer than Earth!
Why's Mercury the closest planet to the Sun?,It formed that way billions of years ago when the Solar System was born – it just happened to be the nearest one.
How big is Mercury compared to Earth?,"Mercury is much smaller – if Earth were the size of a basketball, Mercury would be like a tennis ball."
Does Mercury have any moons?,"No, Mercury has zero moons."
What's the surface of Mercury like?,"It’s rocky, gray, and covered in thousands of craters from asteroid hits, just like our Moon."
Why does Mercury have so many craters?,"It has almost no air or atmosphere to burn up space rocks, so they crash right into it."
How hot does Mercury get during the day?,It can reach over 400°C (800°F) – hotter than an oven!
Why's Mercury so hot?,It’s very close to the Sun and the sunlight is super strong there.
How cold does Mercury get at night?,It can drop to -170°C (-280°F) – colder than a freezer!
Why does Mercury get so cold at night?,"It has almost no atmosphere to trap the heat, so all the warmth escapes into space."
How long is one day on Mercury?,One day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days – that’s a very long school day!
How long is one year on Mercury?,A year on Mercury is only 88 Earth days because it zooms around the Sun so fast.
Does Mercury have an atmosphere?,It has a very thin layer of gas called an exosphere – it’s almost like having no air at all.
Why can’t people breathe on Mercury?,"There’s almost no oxygen and the air is way too thin, hot, and full of radiation."
What color is Mercury?,"Mercury looks gray and rocky, a bit like the Moon."
Who was Mercury named after?,It was named after the speedy messenger of the Roman gods because it moves so fast across the sky.
Can we see Mercury from Earth without a telescope?,Yes! It’s sometimes visible just after sunset or before sunrise – it’s called the “evening star” or “morning star.”
What spacecraft have visited Mercury?,Two spacecraft: Mariner 10 in the 1970s and MESSENGER from 2004–2015.
What did MESSENGER discover?,"It found ice in deep craters near the poles that never see sunlight, even though Mercury is super hot!"
Is there ice on Mercury?,"Yes, hidden in shadowy craters at the north and south poles where the Sun never shines."
Why doesn’t the ice melt on Mercury?,"Those craters are always in shadow and super cold, and there’s no air to carry heat to them."
How fast does Mercury travel around the Sun?,It zooms at about 47 kilometers per second (29 miles per second) – the fastest planet!
Does Mercury have rings like Saturn?,"No, Mercury has no rings at all."
What's the biggest crater on Mercury?,It’s the Caloris Basin – so huge you could fit the whole state of Texas inside it!
Why's Mercury’s sky black even in daytime?,"It has almost no atmosphere to scatter sunlight, so the sky stays black and you can see stars during the day."
Can people ever live on Mercury?,"Probably not – it’s too hot, too cold, no air, and too much radiation from the Sun."
How many times could Mercury fit inside Earth?,About 18 Mercurys could fit inside Earth.
What's Mercury mostly made of?,It has a huge iron core (almost 75% of the planet) covered by a thin rocky layer.
Why does Mercury have such a big iron core?,"Scientists think a giant crash long ago knocked away most of the rocky outside, leaving the heavy iron."
Is Mercury shrinking?,"Yes! It’s slowly cooling inside and shrinking a tiny bit, making wrinkle-like cliffs."
What are those wrinkle cliffs called?,They’re called “scarps” or “lobate scarps.”
How long would it take to drive around Mercury in a car?,"If you drove 100 km/h without stopping, it would take about 60 Earth days to go all the way around."
Can you explain why Mercury has no seasons?,"Actually, Mercury has almost no tilt, so it doesn’t really have seasons like Earth."
Where's the hottest place on Mercury?,Right at the point facing the Sun at noon – it can get hotter than 430°C!
Where's the coldest place on Mercury?,In the bottoms of polar craters that never see sunlight.
Why does the Sun look bigger from Mercury?,"Because Mercury is closer to the Sun, the Sun appears almost three times bigger than from Earth."
What's Mercury’s gravity like compared to Earth?,It’s only about 38% of Earth’s gravity – you would weigh much less and could jump really high!
How many people have walked on Mercury?,Zero – no human has ever been there; only robots!
What's the brightest planet we see from Earth?,"Venus is usually brighter, but Mercury can look very bright when conditions are right."
Can you see Mercury during the day?,Very rarely and only with a telescope because the Sun is too bright.
Why does Mercury always show the same side to the Sun sometimes?,"Actually, it spins 3 times for every 2 orbits, so different parts get sunlight."
What's a transit of Mercury?,When Mercury passes directly between Earth and the Sun – it looks like a tiny black dot crossing the Sun.
How often do we study Mercury today?,Scientists use telescopes on Earth and data from the old MESSENGER mission.
Will we send another spacecraft to Mercury?,Yes! A mission called BepiColombo (from Europe and Japan) is on its way and will arrive in 2025–2026.

Is Venus bigger or smaller than Earth?,Venus is almost the same size as Earth – it’s like Earth’s twin sister!
Why do we call Venus Earth’s twin?,"Because it’s almost the same size and made of rock, but it’s way too hot to live on."
How far is Venus from the Sun?,Venus is about 108 million kilometers (67 million miles) from the Sun.
How hot is Venus?,It’s over 460°C (860°F) all the time – hot enough to melt lead!
Why's Venus the hottest planet?,It has a super thick blanket of carbon dioxide gas that traps heat like a giant greenhouse.
What's the greenhouse effect on Venus?,"The thick atmosphere traps the Sun’s heat so it can’t escape, making the planet super toasty."
Does Venus have any moons?,"No, Venus has zero moons."
How long is one day on Venus?,One day on Venus (sunrise to sunrise) lasts 243 Earth days – longer than its year!
How long is a year on Venus?,A year on Venus is 225 Earth days – shorter than on Earth.
Why does Venus spin backwards?,Venus spins the opposite way from most planets – on Venus the Sun rises in the west!
What color is Venus in the sky?,Venus is bright white-yellow and is the brightest thing in the sky after the Sun and Moon.
Why's Venus so bright from Earth?,"It’s covered in thick white clouds that reflect sunlight really well, and it comes quite close to Earth."
Can we see Venus without a telescope?,Yes! It’s often called the Evening Star or Morning Star because it shines so brightly.
What are the clouds on Venus made of?,"They’re made of sulfuric acid – like nasty, poisonous rain that never reaches the ground."
Does it rain on Venus?,"Yes, but the rain is sulfuric acid and it evaporates before hitting the ground."
What's the surface of Venus like?,"It’s rocky with thousands of volcanoes, huge lava plains, and mountains."
Are there active volcanoes on Venus?,Scientists think some might still be active – Venus is a very volcanic world!
How thick is Venus’s atmosphere?,It’s about 90 times thicker than Earth’s – it would crush you like the bottom of the ocean.
Can humans breathe on Venus?,No way! The air is mostly carbon dioxide and full of poisonous gases.
Who was Venus named after?,Venus was named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty because it looks so pretty in the sky.
How many spacecraft have landed on Venus?,Only Soviet spacecraft have landed – the Venera probes – and they melted quickly!
How long did the longest Venus lander survive?,The record is about 2 hours before the heat and pressure destroyed it.
Is there lightning on Venus?,Yes! Scientists have seen huge lightning storms in the thick clouds.
Why does Venus have almost no water?,The extreme heat long ago boiled all the water away into space.
Does Venus have craters?,Not many – lava from volcanoes covered most old craters.
What's the highest mountain on Venus?,Maxwell Montes – it’s taller than Mount Everest!
How strong is the wind on Venus?,"Near the ground it’s slow, but high in the clouds it blows over 350 km/h – faster than a hurricane!"
What's super-rotation on Venus?,The clouds go all the way around the planet in just 4 Earth days even though the planet spins slowly.
Is there ice on Venus?,No – it’s far too hot everywhere for ice.
What's Venus’s sky color if you stood there?,It would look orange-yellow because of the thick clouds.
Can people ever live on Venus?,"Not on the ground, but some scientists dream about floating cities high in the cooler clouds."
How much would you weigh on Venus?,Almost the same as on Earth because it’s nearly the same size and gravity.
What's a transit of Venus?,When Venus passes directly between Earth and the Sun – it looks like a small black dot on the Sun.
How often does a transit of Venus happen?,"Very rarely – they come in pairs 8 years apart, then wait over 100 years."
Does Venus have seasons?,"No, because it has almost no tilt – every day is the same."
Where's the pressure highest on Venus?,On the surface – it’s like being 900 meters under the ocean on Earth.
Why can’t we see the surface of Venus with normal telescopes?,The thick clouds hide everything – we need radar to see through them.
What spacecraft mapped Venus with radar?,The Magellan spacecraft in the 1990s made the best maps of the hidden surface.
Is Venus getting hotter or cooler?,It’s stayed about the same super-hot temperature for billions of years.
What's the Soviet Venera program?,A series of brave Russian probes that took the only photos ever from Venus’s surface.
Can you see stars from Venus during the day?,No – the thick clouds make the sky bright all the time.
Why does Venus shine so long in the evening?,"It follows the Sun down or comes up before the Sun, so we can see it for hours."
Does Venus have earthquakes?,They’re called venusquakes – the ground sometimes shakes from shrinking or volcanoes.
How many volcanoes are on Venus?,"Over 1,600 big ones have been counted, and probably millions of small ones!"
Is Venus a rocky planet?,"Yes, it’s a rocky terrestrial planet just like Earth, Mercury, and Mars."
What would happen if you took off your spacesuit on Venus?,"You’d be crushed, burned, and poisoned all at once in seconds!"
Will we go back to Venus soon?,Yes! NASA and Europe are planning new missions like VERITAS and EnVision for the 2030s.
What's special about Venus’s day being longer than its year?,It’s the only planet where a day lasts longer than a year – very strange!
Why's Venus sometimes called Earth’s evil twin?,Because it’s almost the same size but turned into a deadly hot hell instead of a nice home.

How often do we study Mercury today?,Scientists use telescopes on Earth and data from the old MESSENGER mission.
Will we send another spacecraft to Mercury?,Yes! A mission called BepiColombo (from Europe and Japan) is on its way and will arrive in 2025–2026.
What is special about Mercury’s orbit?,It’s the most oval (elliptical) orbit of any planet except Pluto.
Why is it hard to send spacecraft to Mercury?,"The Sun’s gravity is so strong that spacecraft have to slow down a lot, which takes many fly-bys."
How many Earth days equal one Mercury day at the equator?,"Because of the slow spin, one full day-night cycle is 176 Earth days."
Is Mercury a rocky planet or a gas planet?,"Mercury is a rocky (terrestrial) planet, like Earth, Venus, and Mars."
What would happen if you dropped a feather and a hammer on Mercury?,They would hit the ground at the same time (just like on the Moon) because there’s almost no air.
What is Mercury?,Mercury is the smallest planet in our Solar System and the closest planet to the Sun.
How far is Mercury from the Sun?,Mercury is about 58 million kilometers (36 million miles) from the Sun on average – much closer than Earth!
Why is Mercury the closest planet to the Sun?,It formed that way billions of years ago when the Solar System was born – it just happened to be the nearest one.
How big is Mercury compared to Earth?,"Mercury is much smaller – if Earth were the size of a basketball, Mercury would be like a tennis ball."
Does Mercury have any moons?,"No, Mercury has zero moons."
What is the surface of Mercury like?,"It’s rocky, gray, and covered in thousands of craters from asteroid hits, just like our Moon."
Why does Mercury have so many craters?,"It has almost no air or atmosphere to burn up space rocks, so they crash right into it."
How hot does Mercury get during the day?,It can reach over 400°C (800°F) – hotter than an oven!
Why is Mercury so hot?,It’s very close to the Sun and the sunlight is super strong there.
How cold does Mercury get at night?,It can drop to -170°C (-280°F) – colder than a freezer!
Why does Mercury get so cold at night?,"It has almost no atmosphere to trap the heat, so all the warmth escapes into space."
How long is one day on Mercury?,One day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days – that’s a very long school day!
How long is one year on Mercury?,A year on Mercury is only 88 Earth days because it zooms around the Sun so fast.
Does Mercury have an atmosphere?,It has a very thin layer of gas called an exosphere – it’s almost like having no air at all.
Why can’t people breathe on Mercury?,"There’s almost no oxygen and the air is way too thin, hot, and full of radiation."
What color is Mercury?,"Mercury looks gray and rocky, a bit like the Moon."
Who was Mercury named after?,It was named after the speedy messenger of the Roman gods because it moves so fast across the sky.
Can we see Mercury from Earth without a telescope?,Yes! It’s sometimes visible just after sunset or before sunrise – it’s called the “evening star” or “morning star.”
What spacecraft have visited Mercury?,Two spacecraft: Mariner 10 in the 1970s and MESSENGER from 2004–2015.
What did MESSENGER discover?,"It found ice in deep craters near the poles that never see sunlight, even though Mercury is super hot!"
Is there ice on Mercury?,"Yes, hidden in shadowy craters at the north and south poles where the Sun never shines."
Why doesn’t the ice melt on Mercury?,"Those craters are always in shadow and super cold, and there’s no air to carry heat to them."
How fast does Mercury travel around the Sun?,It zooms at about 47 kilometers per second (29 miles per second) – the fastest planet!
Does Mercury have rings like Saturn?,"No, Mercury has no rings at all."
What is the biggest crater on Mercury?,It’s the Caloris Basin – so huge you could fit the whole state of Texas inside it!
Why is Mercury’s sky black even in daytime?,"It has almost no atmosphere to scatter sunlight, so the sky stays black and you can see stars during the day."
Can people ever live on Mercury?,"Probably not – it’s too hot, too cold, no air, and too much radiation from the Sun."
How many times could Mercury fit inside Earth?,About 18 Mercurys could fit inside Earth.
What is Mercury mostly made of?,It has a huge iron core (almost 75% of the planet) covered by a thin rocky layer.
Why does Mercury have such a big iron core?,"Scientists think a giant crash long ago knocked away most of the rocky outside, leaving the heavy iron."
Is Mercury shrinking?,"Yes! It’s slowly cooling inside and shrinking a tiny bit, making wrinkle-like cliffs."
What are those wrinkle cliffs called?,They’re called “scarps” or “lobate scarps.”
How long would it take to drive around Mercury in a car?,"If you drove 100 km/h without stopping, it would take about 60 Earth days to go all the way around."
Can you explain why Mercury has no seasons?,"Actually, Mercury has almost no tilt, so it doesn’t really have seasons like Earth."
Where is the hottest place on Mercury?,Right at the point facing the Sun at noon – it can get hotter than 430°C!
Where is the coldest place on Mercury?,In the bottoms of polar craters that never see sunlight.
Why does the Sun look bigger from Mercury?,"Because Mercury is closer to the Sun, the Sun appears almost three times bigger than from Earth."
What is Mercury’s gravity like compared to Earth?,It’s only about 38% of Earth’s gravity – you would weigh much less and could jump really high!
How many people have walked on Mercury?,Zero – no human has ever been there; only robots!
What is the brightest planet we see from Earth?,"Venus is usually brighter, but Mercury can look very bright when conditions are right."
Can you see Mercury during the day?,Very rarely and only with a telescope because the Sun is too bright.
Why does Mercury always show the same side to the Sun sometimes?,"Actually, it spins 3 times for every 2 orbits, so different parts get sunlight."

What is Mercury?,Mercury is the smallest planet in our Solar System and the closest planet to the Sun.
How far is Mercury from the Sun?,Mercury is about 58 million kilometers (36 million miles) from the Sun on average – much closer than Earth!
Why is Mercury the closest planet to the Sun?,It formed that way billions of years ago when the Solar System was born – it just happened to be the nearest one.
How big is Mercury compared to Earth?,"Mercury is much smaller – if Earth were the size of a basketball, Mercury would be like a tennis ball."
Does Mercury have any moons?,"No, Mercury has zero moons."
What is the surface of Mercury like?,"It’s rocky, gray, and covered in thousands of craters from asteroid hits, just like our Moon."
Why does Mercury have so many craters?,"It has almost no air or atmosphere to burn up space rocks, so they crash right into it."
How hot does Mercury get during the day?,It can reach over 400°C (800°F) – hotter than an oven!
Why is Mercury so hot?,It’s very close to the Sun and the sunlight is super strong there.
How cold does Mercury get at night?,It can drop to -170°C (-280°F) – colder than a freezer!
Why does Mercury get so cold at night?,"It has almost no atmosphere to trap the heat, so all the warmth escapes into space."
How long is one day on Mercury?,One day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days – that’s a very long school day!
How long is one year on Mercury?,A year on Mercury is only 88 Earth days because it zooms around the Sun so fast.
Does Mercury have an atmosphere?,It has a very thin layer of gas called an exosphere – it’s almost like having no air at all.
Why can’t people breathe on Mercury?,"There’s almost no oxygen and the air is way too thin, hot, and full of radiation."
What color is Mercury?,"Mercury looks gray and rocky, a bit like the Moon."
Who was Mercury named after?,It was named after the speedy messenger of the Roman gods because it moves so fast across the sky.
Can we see Mercury from Earth without a telescope?,Yes! It’s sometimes visible just after sunset or before sunrise – it’s called the “evening star” or “morning star.”
What spacecraft have visited Mercury?,Two spacecraft: Mariner 10 in the 1970s and MESSENGER from 2004–2015.
What did MESSENGER discover?,"It found ice in deep craters near the poles that never see sunlight, even though Mercury is super hot!"
Is there ice on Mercury?,"Yes, hidden in shadowy craters at the north and south poles where the Sun never shines."
Why doesn’t the ice melt on Mercury?,"Those craters are always in shadow and super cold, and there’s no air to carry heat to them."
How fast does Mercury travel around the Sun?,It zooms at about 47 kilometers per second (29 miles per second) – the fastest planet!
Does Mercury have rings like Saturn?,"No, Mercury has no rings at all."
What is the biggest crater on Mercury?,It’s the Caloris Basin – so huge you could fit the whole state of Texas inside it!
Why is Mercury’s sky black even in daytime?,"It has almost no atmosphere to scatter sunlight, so the sky stays black and you can see stars during the day."
Can people ever live on Mercury?,"Probably not – it’s too hot, too cold, no air, and too much radiation from the Sun."
How many times could Mercury fit inside Earth?,About 18 Mercurys could fit inside Earth.
What is Mercury mostly made of?,It has a huge iron core (almost 75% of the planet) covered by a thin rocky layer.
Why does Mercury have such a big iron core?,"Scientists think a giant crash long ago knocked away most of the rocky outside, leaving the heavy iron."
Is Mercury shrinking?,"Yes! It’s slowly cooling inside and shrinking a tiny bit, making wrinkle-like cliffs."
What are those wrinkle cliffs called?,They’re called “scarps” or “lobate scarps.”
How long would it take to drive around Mercury in a car?,"If you drove 100 km/h without stopping, it would take about 60 Earth days to go all the way around."
Can you explain why Mercury has no seasons?,"Actually, Mercury has almost no tilt, so it doesn’t really have seasons like Earth."
Where is the hottest place on Mercury?,Right at the point facing the Sun at noon – it can get hotter than 430°C!
Where is the coldest place on Mercury?,In the bottoms of polar craters that never see sunlight.
Why does the Sun look bigger from Mercury?,"Because Mercury is closer to the Sun, the Sun appears almost three times bigger than from Earth."
What is Mercury’s gravity like compared to Earth?,It’s only about 38% of Earth’s gravity – you would weigh much less and could jump really high!
How many people have walked on Mercury?,Zero – no human has ever been there; only robots!
What is the brightest planet we see from Earth?,"Venus is usually brighter, but Mercury can look very bright when conditions are right."
Can you see Mercury during the day?,Very rarely and only with a telescope because the Sun is too bright.
Why does Mercury always show the same side to the Sun sometimes?,"Actually, it spins 3 times for every 2 orbits, so different parts get sunlight."
What is a transit of Mercury?,When Mercury passes directly between Earth and the Sun – it looks like a tiny black dot crossing the Sun.
How often do we study Mercury today?,Scientists use telescopes on Earth and data from the old MESSENGER mission.
Will we send another spacecraft to Mercury?,Yes! A mission called BepiColombo (from Europe and Japan) is on its way and will arrive in 2025–2026.
What is special about Mercury’s orbit?,It’s the most oval (elliptical) orbit of any planet except Pluto.
Why is it hard to send spacecraft to Mercury?,"The Sun’s gravity is so strong that spacecraft have to slow down a lot, which takes many fly-bys."
How many Earth days equal one Mercury day at the equator?,"Because of the slow spin, one full day-night cycle is 176 Earth days."
Is Mercury a rocky planet or a gas planet?,"Mercury is a rocky (terrestrial) planet, like Earth, Venus, and Mars."

Why is Mercury so hot?,It’s very close to the Sun and the sunlight is super strong there.
How cold does Mercury get at night?,It can drop to -170°C (-280°F) – colder than a freezer!
Why does Mercury get so cold at night?,"It has almost no atmosphere to trap the heat, so all the warmth escapes into space."
How long is one day on Mercury?,One day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days – that’s a very long school day!
How long is one year on Mercury?,A year on Mercury is only 88 Earth days because it zooms around the Sun so fast.
Does Mercury have an atmosphere?,It has a very thin layer of gas called an exosphere – it’s almost like having no air at all.
Why can’t people breathe on Mercury?,"There’s almost no oxygen and the air is way too thin, hot, and full of radiation."
What color is Mercury?,"Mercury looks gray and rocky, a bit like the Moon."
Who was Mercury named after?,It was named after the speedy messenger of the Roman gods because it moves so fast across the sky.
Can we see Mercury from Earth without a telescope?,Yes! It’s sometimes visible just after sunset or before sunrise – it’s called the “evening star” or “morning star.”
What spacecraft have visited Mercury?,Two spacecraft: Mariner 10 in the 1970s and MESSENGER from 2004–2015.
What did MESSENGER discover?,"It found ice in deep craters near the poles that never see sunlight, even though Mercury is super hot!"
Is there ice on Mercury?,"Yes, hidden in shadowy craters at the north and south poles where the Sun never shines."
Why doesn’t the ice melt on Mercury?,"Those craters are always in shadow and super cold, and there’s no air to carry heat to them."
How fast does Mercury travel around the Sun?,It zooms at about 47 kilometers per second (29 miles per second) – the fastest planet!
Does Mercury have rings like Saturn?,"No, Mercury has no rings at all."
What is the biggest crater on Mercury?,It’s the Caloris Basin – so huge you could fit the whole state of Texas inside it!
Why is Mercury’s sky black even in daytime?,"It has almost no atmosphere to scatter sunlight, so the sky stays black and you can see stars during the day."
Can people ever live on Mercury?,"Probably not – it’s too hot, too cold, no air, and too much radiation from the Sun."
How many times could Mercury fit inside Earth?,About 18 Mercurys could fit inside Earth.
What is Mercury mostly made of?,It has a huge iron core (almost 75% of the planet) covered by a thin rocky layer.
Why does Mercury have such a big iron core?,"Scientists think a giant crash long ago knocked away most of the rocky outside, leaving the heavy iron."
Is Mercury shrinking?,"Yes! It’s slowly cooling inside and shrinking a tiny bit, making wrinkle-like cliffs."
What are those wrinkle cliffs called?,They’re called “scarps” or “lobate scarps.”
How long would it take to drive around Mercury in a car?,"If you drove 100 km/h without stopping, it would take about 60 Earth days to go all the way around."
Can you explain why Mercury has no seasons?,"Actually, Mercury has almost no tilt, so it doesn’t really have seasons like Earth."
Where is the hottest place on Mercury?,Right at the point facing the Sun at noon – it can get hotter than 430°C!
Where is the coldest place on Mercury?,In the bottoms of polar craters that never see sunlight.
Why does the Sun look bigger from Mercury?,"Because Mercury is closer to the Sun, the Sun appears almost three times bigger than from Earth."
What is Mercury’s gravity like compared to Earth?,It’s only about 38% of Earth’s gravity – you would weigh much less and could jump really high!
How many people have walked on Mercury?,Zero – no human has ever been there; only robots!
What is the brightest planet we see from Earth?,"Venus is usually brighter, but Mercury can look very bright when conditions are right."
Can you see Mercury during the day?,Very rarely and only with a telescope because the Sun is too bright.
Why does Mercury always show the same side to the Sun sometimes?,"Actually, it spins 3 times for every 2 orbits, so different parts get sunlight."
What is a transit of Mercury?,When Mercury passes directly between Earth and the Sun – it looks like a tiny black dot crossing the Sun.
How often do we study Mercury today?,Scientists use telescopes on Earth and data from the old MESSENGER mission.
Will we send another spacecraft to Mercury?,Yes! A mission called BepiColombo (from Europe and Japan) is on its way and will arrive in 2025–2026.
What is special about Mercury’s orbit?,It’s the most oval (elliptical) orbit of any planet except Pluto.
Why is it hard to send spacecraft to Mercury?,"The Sun’s gravity is so strong that spacecraft have to slow down a lot, which takes many fly-bys."
How many Earth days equal one Mercury day at the equator?,"Because of the slow spin, one full day-night cycle is 176 Earth days."
Is Mercury a rocky planet or a gas planet?,"Mercury is a rocky (terrestrial) planet, like Earth, Venus, and Mars."
What would happen if you dropped a feather and a hammer on Mercury?,They would hit the ground at the same time (just like on the Moon) because there’s almost no air.
What is Venus?,Venus is the second planet from the Sun and the hottest planet in our Solar System.
Is Venus bigger or smaller than Earth?,Venus is almost the same size as Earth – it’s like Earth’s twin sister!
Why do we call Venus Earth’s twin?,"Because it’s almost the same size and made of rock, but it’s way too hot to live on."
How far is Venus from the Sun?,Venus is about 108 million kilometers (67 million miles) from the Sun.
How hot is Venus?,It’s over 460°C (860°F) all the time – hot enough to melt lead!
Why is Venus the hottest planet?,It has a super thick blanket of carbon dioxide gas that traps heat like a giant greenhouse.
What is the greenhouse effect on Venus?,"The thick atmosphere traps the Sun’s heat so it can’t escape, making the planet super toasty."
Does Venus have any moons?,"No, Venus has zero moons."
How long is one day on Venus?,One day on Venus (sunrise to sunrise) lasts 243 Earth days – longer than its year!
How long is a year on Venus?,A year on Venus is 225 Earth days – shorter than on Earth.

How often does a transit of Venus happen?,"Very rarely – they come in pairs 8 years apart, then wait over 100 years."
Does Venus have seasons?,"No, because it has almost no tilt – every day is the same."
Where is the pressure highest on Venus?,On the surface – it’s like being 900 meters under the ocean on Earth.
Why can’t we see the surface of Venus with normal telescopes?,The thick clouds hide everything – we need radar to see through them.
What spacecraft mapped Venus with radar?,The Magellan spacecraft in the 1990s made the best maps of the hidden surface.
Is Venus getting hotter or cooler?,It’s stayed about the same super-hot temperature for billions of years.
What is the Soviet Venera program?,A series of brave Russian probes that took the only photos ever from Venus’s surface.

What's Mercury?,Mercury is the smallest planet in our Solar System and the closest planet to the Sun.
How far is Mercury from the Sun?,Mercury is about 58 million kilometers (36 million miles) from the Sun on average – much closer than Earth!
Why's Mercury the closest planet to the Sun?,It formed that way billions of years ago when the Solar System was born – it just happened to be the nearest one.
How big is Mercury compared to Earth?,"Mercury is much smaller – if Earth were the size of a basketball, Mercury would be like a tennis ball."
Does Mercury have any moons?,"No, Mercury has zero moons."
What's the surface of Mercury like?,"It’s rocky, gray, and covered in thousands of craters from asteroid hits, just like our Moon."
Why does Mercury have so many craters?,"It has almost no air or atmosphere to burn up space rocks, so they crash right into it."
How hot does Mercury get during the day?,It can reach over 400°C (800°F) – hotter than an oven!
Why's Mercury so hot?,It’s very close to the Sun and the sunlight is super strong there.
How cold does Mercury get at night?,It can drop to -170°C (-280°F) – colder than a freezer!
Why does Mercury get so cold at night?,"It has almost no atmosphere to trap the heat, so all the warmth escapes into space."
How long is one day on Mercury?,One day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days – that’s a very long school day!
How long is one year on Mercury?,A year on Mercury is only 88 Earth days because it zooms around the Sun so fast.
Does Mercury have an atmosphere?,It has a very thin layer of gas called an exosphere – it’s almost like having no air at all.
Why can’t people breathe on Mercury?,"There’s almost no oxygen and the air is way too thin, hot, and full of radiation."
What color is Mercury?,"Mercury looks gray and rocky, a bit like the Moon."
Who was Mercury named after?,It was named after the speedy messenger of the Roman gods because it moves so fast across the sky.
Can we see Mercury from Earth without a telescope?,Yes! It’s sometimes visible just after sunset or before sunrise – it’s called the “evening star” or “morning star.”
What spacecraft have visited Mercury?,Two spacecraft: Mariner 10 in the 1970s and MESSENGER from 2004–2015.
What did MESSENGER discover?,"It found ice in deep craters near the poles that never see sunlight, even though Mercury is super hot!"
Is there ice on Mercury?,"Yes, hidden in shadowy craters at the north and south poles where the Sun never shines."
Why doesn’t the ice melt on Mercury?,"Those craters are always in shadow and super cold, and there’s no air to carry heat to them."
How fast does Mercury travel around the Sun?,It zooms at about 47 kilometers per second (29 miles per second) – the fastest planet!
Does Mercury have rings like Saturn?,"No, Mercury has no rings at all."
What's the biggest crater on Mercury?,It’s the Caloris Basin – so huge you could fit the whole state of Texas inside it!
Why's Mercury’s sky black even in daytime?,"It has almost no atmosphere to scatter sunlight, so the sky stays black and you can see stars during the day."
Can people ever live on Mercury?,"Probably not – it’s too hot, too cold, no air, and too much radiation from the Sun."
How many times could Mercury fit inside Earth?,About 18 Mercurys could fit inside Earth.
What's Mercury mostly made of?,It has a huge iron core (almost 75% of the planet) covered by a thin rocky layer.
Why does Mercury have such a big iron core?,"Scientists think a giant crash long ago knocked away most of the rocky outside, leaving the heavy iron."
Is Mercury shrinking?,"Yes! It’s slowly cooling inside and shrinking a tiny bit, making wrinkle-like cliffs."
What are those wrinkle cliffs called?,They’re called “scarps” or “lobate scarps.”
How long would it take to drive around Mercury in a car?,"If you drove 100 km/h without stopping, it would take about 60 Earth days to go all the way around."
Can you explain why Mercury has no seasons?,"Actually, Mercury has almost no tilt, so it doesn’t really have seasons like Earth."
Where's the hottest place on Mercury?,Right at the point facing the Sun at noon – it can get hotter than 430°C!
Where's the coldest place on Mercury?,In the bottoms of polar craters that never see sunlight.
Why does the Sun look bigger from Mercury?,"Because Mercury is closer to the Sun, the Sun appears almost three times bigger than from Earth."
What's Mercury’s gravity like compared to Earth?,It’s only about 38% of Earth’s gravity – you would weigh much less and could jump really high!
How many people have walked on Mercury?,Zero – no human has ever been there; only robots!
What's the brightest planet we see from Earth?,"Venus is usually brighter, but Mercury can look very bright when conditions are right."
Can you see Mercury during the day?,Very rarely and only with a telescope because the Sun is too bright.
Why does Mercury always show the same side to the Sun sometimes?,"Actually, it spins 3 times for every 2 orbits, so different parts get sunlight."
What's a transit of Mercury?,When Mercury passes directly between Earth and the Sun – it looks like a tiny black dot crossing the Sun.
How often do we study Mercury today?,Scientists use telescopes on Earth and data from the old MESSENGER mission.
Will we send another spacecraft to Mercury?,Yes! A mission called BepiColombo (from Europe and Japan) is on its way and will arrive in 2025–2026.
What's special about Mercury’s orbit?,It’s the most oval (elliptical) orbit of any planet except Pluto.
Why's it hard to send spacecraft to Mercury?,"The Sun’s gravity is so strong that spacecraft have to slow down a lot, which takes many fly-bys."
How many Earth days equal one Mercury day at the equator?,"Because of the slow spin, one full day-night cycle is 176 Earth days."
Is Mercury a rocky planet or a gas planet?,"Mercury is a rocky (terrestrial) planet, like Earth, Venus, and Mars."
What would happen if you dropped a feather and a hammer on Mercury?,They would hit the ground at the same time (just like on the Moon) because there’s almost no air.
What's Mercury?,Mercury is the smallest planet in our Solar System and the closest planet to the Sun.
How far is Mercury from the Sun?,Mercury is about 58 million kilometers (36 million miles) from the Sun on average – much closer than Earth!
Why's Mercury the closest planet to the Sun?,It formed that way billions of years ago when the Solar System was born – it just happened to be the nearest one.
How big is Mercury compared to Earth?,"Mercury is much smaller – if Earth were the size of a basketball, Mercury would be like a tennis ball."
Does Mercury have any moons?,"No, Mercury has zero moons."
What's the surface of Mercury like?,"It’s rocky, gray, and covered in thousands of craters from asteroid hits, just like our Moon."
Why does Mercury have so many craters?,"It has almost no air or atmosphere to burn up space rocks, so they crash right into it."
How hot does Mercury get during the day?,It can reach over 400°C (800°F) – hotter than an oven!
Why's Mercury so hot?,It’s very close to the Sun and the sunlight is super strong there.
How cold does Mercury get at night?,It can drop to -170°C (-280°F) – colder than a freezer!
Why does Mercury get so cold at night?,"It has almost no atmosphere to trap the heat, so all the warmth escapes into space."
How long is one day on Mercury?,One day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days – that’s a very long school day!
How long is one year on Mercury?,A year on Mercury is only 88 Earth days because it zooms around the Sun so fast.
Does Mercury have an atmosphere?,It has a very thin layer of gas called an exosphere – it’s almost like having no air at all.
Why can’t people breathe on Mercury?,"There’s almost no oxygen and the air is way too thin, hot, and full of radiation."
What color is Mercury?,"Mercury looks gray and rocky, a bit like the Moon."
Who was Mercury named after?,It was named after the speedy messenger of the Roman gods because it moves so fast across the sky.
Can we see Mercury from Earth without a telescope?,Yes! It’s sometimes visible just after sunset or before sunrise – it’s called the “evening star” or “morning star.”
What spacecraft have visited Mercury?,Two spacecraft: Mariner 10 in the 1970s and MESSENGER from 2004–2015.
What did MESSENGER discover?,"It found ice in deep craters near the poles that never see sunlight, even though Mercury is super hot!"
Is there ice on Mercury?,"Yes, hidden in shadowy craters at the north and south poles where the Sun never shines."
Why doesn’t the ice melt on Mercury?,"Those craters are always in shadow and super cold, and there’s no air to carry heat to them."
How fast does Mercury travel around the Sun?,It zooms at about 47 kilometers per second (29 miles per second) – the fastest planet!
Does Mercury have rings like Saturn?,"No, Mercury has no rings at all."
What's the biggest crater on Mercury?,It’s the Caloris Basin – so huge you could fit the whole state of Texas inside it!
Why's Mercury’s sky black even in daytime?,"It has almost no atmosphere to scatter sunlight, so the sky stays black and you can see stars during the day."
Can people ever live on Mercury?,"Probably not – it’s too hot, too cold, no air, and too much radiation from the Sun."
How many times could Mercury fit inside Earth?,About 18 Mercurys could fit inside Earth.
What's Mercury mostly made of?,It has a huge iron core (almost 75% of the planet) covered by a thin rocky layer.
Why does Mercury have such a big iron core?,"Scientists think a giant crash long ago knocked away most of the rocky outside, leaving the heavy iron."
Is Mercury shrinking?,"Yes! It’s slowly cooling inside and shrinking a tiny bit, making wrinkle-like cliffs."
What are those wrinkle cliffs called?,They’re called “scarps” or “lobate scarps.”
How long would it take to drive around Mercury in a car?,"If you drove 100 km/h without stopping, it would take about 60 Earth days to go all the way around."

What's the brightest planet we see from Earth?,"Venus is usually brighter, but Mercury can look very bright when conditions are right."
Can you see Mercury during the day?,Very rarely and only with a telescope because the Sun is too bright.
Why does Mercury always show the same side to the Sun sometimes?,"Actually, it spins 3 times for every 2 orbits, so different parts get sunlight."
What's a transit of Mercury?,When Mercury passes directly between Earth and the Sun – it looks like a tiny black dot crossing the Sun.
How often do we study Mercury today?,Scientists use telescopes on Earth and data from the old MESSENGER mission.
Will we send another spacecraft to Mercury?,Yes! A mission called BepiColombo (from Europe and Japan) is on its way and will arrive in 2025–2026.
What's special about Mercury’s orbit?,It’s the most oval (elliptical) orbit of any planet except Pluto.
Why's it hard to send spacecraft to Mercury?,"The Sun’s gravity is so strong that spacecraft have to slow down a lot, which takes many fly-bys."
How many Earth days equal one Mercury day at the equator?,"Because of the slow spin, one full day-night cycle is 176 Earth days."
Is Mercury a rocky planet or a gas planet?,"Mercury is a rocky (terrestrial) planet, like Earth, Venus, and Mars."
What would happen if you dropped a feather and a hammer on Mercury?,They would hit the ground at the same time (just like on the Moon) because there’s almost no air.
What's Mercury?,Mercury is the smallest planet in our Solar System and the closest planet to the Sun.
How far is Mercury from the Sun?,Mercury is about 58 million kilometers (36 million miles) from the Sun on average – much closer than Earth!
Why's Mercury the closest planet to the Sun?,It formed that way billions of years ago when the Solar System was born – it just happened to be the nearest one.
How big is Mercury compared to Earth?,"Mercury is much smaller – if Earth were the size of a basketball, Mercury would be like a tennis ball."
Does Mercury have any moons?,"No, Mercury has zero moons."
What's the surface of Mercury like?,"It’s rocky, gray, and covered in thousands of craters from asteroid hits, just like our Moon."
Why does Mercury have so many craters?,"It has almost no air or atmosphere to burn up space rocks, so they crash right into it."
How hot does Mercury get during the day?,It can reach over 400°C (800°F) – hotter than an oven!
Why's Mercury so hot?,It’s very close to the Sun and the sunlight is super strong there.
How cold does Mercury get at night?,It can drop to -170°C (-280°F) – colder than a freezer!
Why does Mercury get so cold at night?,"It has almost no atmosphere to trap the heat, so all the warmth escapes into space."
How long is one day on Mercury?,One day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days – that’s a very long school day!
How long is one year on Mercury?,A year on Mercury is only 88 Earth days because it zooms around the Sun so fast.
Does Mercury have an atmosphere?,It has a very thin layer of gas called an exosphere – it’s almost like having no air at all.
Why can’t people breathe on Mercury?,"There’s almost no oxygen and the air is way too thin, hot, and full of radiation."
What color is Mercury?,"Mercury looks gray and rocky, a bit like the Moon."
Who was Mercury named after?,It was named after the speedy messenger of the Roman gods because it moves so fast across the sky.
Can we see Mercury from Earth without a telescope?,Yes! It’s sometimes visible just after sunset or before sunrise – it’s called the “evening star” or “morning star.”
What spacecraft have visited Mercury?,Two spacecraft: Mariner 10 in the 1970s and MESSENGER from 2004–2015.
What did MESSENGER discover?,"It found ice in deep craters near the poles that never see sunlight, even though Mercury is super hot!"
Is there ice on Mercury?,"Yes, hidden in shadowy craters at the north and south poles where the Sun never shines."
Why doesn’t the ice melt on Mercury?,"Those craters are always in shadow and super cold, and there’s no air to carry heat to them."
How fast does Mercury travel around the Sun?,It zooms at about 47 kilometers per second (29 miles per second) – the fastest planet!
Does Mercury have rings like Saturn?,"No, Mercury has no rings at all."
What's the biggest crater on Mercury?,It’s the Caloris Basin – so huge you could fit the whole state of Texas inside it!
Why's Mercury’s sky black even in daytime?,"It has almost no atmosphere to scatter sunlight, so the sky stays black and you can see stars during the day."
Can people ever live on Mercury?,"Probably not – it’s too hot, too cold, no air, and too much radiation from the Sun."
How many times could Mercury fit inside Earth?,About 18 Mercurys could fit inside Earth.
What's Mercury mostly made of?,It has a huge iron core (almost 75% of the planet) covered by a thin rocky layer.
Why does Mercury have such a big iron core?,"Scientists think a giant crash long ago knocked away most of the rocky outside, leaving the heavy iron."
Is Mercury shrinking?,"Yes! It’s slowly cooling inside and shrinking a tiny bit, making wrinkle-like cliffs."
What are those wrinkle cliffs called?,They’re called “scarps” or “lobate scarps.”
How long would it take to drive around Mercury in a car?,"If you drove 100 km/h without stopping, it would take about 60 Earth days to go all the way around."
Can you explain why Mercury has no seasons?,"Actually, Mercury has almost no tilt, so it doesn’t really have seasons like Earth."
Where's the hottest place on Mercury?,Right at the point facing the Sun at noon – it can get hotter than 430°C!
Where's the coldest place on Mercury?,In the bottoms of polar craters that never see sunlight.
Why does the Sun look bigger from Mercury?,"Because Mercury is closer to the Sun, the Sun appears almost three times bigger than from Earth."
What's Mercury’s gravity like compared to Earth?,It’s only about 38% of Earth’s gravity – you would weigh much less and could jump really high!

Will we send another spacecraft to Mercury?,Yes! A mission called BepiColombo (from Europe and Japan) is on its way and will arrive in 2025–2026.
What's special about Mercury’s orbit?,It’s the most oval (elliptical) orbit of any planet except Pluto.
Why's it hard to send spacecraft to Mercury?,"The Sun’s gravity is so strong that spacecraft have to slow down a lot, which takes many fly-bys."
How many Earth days equal one Mercury day at the equator?,"Because of the slow spin, one full day-night cycle is 176 Earth days."
Is Mercury a rocky planet or a gas planet?,"Mercury is a rocky (terrestrial) planet, like Earth, Venus, and Mars."
What would happen if you dropped a feather and a hammer on Mercury?,They would hit the ground at the same time (just like on the Moon) because there’s almost no air.
What's Mercury?,Mercury is the smallest planet in our Solar System and the closest planet to the Sun.
How far is Mercury from the Sun?,Mercury is about 58 million kilometers (36 million miles) from the Sun on average – much closer than Earth!
Why's Mercury the closest planet to the Sun?,It formed that way billions of years ago when the Solar System was born – it just happened to be the nearest one.
How big is Mercury compared to Earth?,"Mercury is much smaller – if Earth were the size of a basketball, Mercury would be like a tennis ball."
Does Mercury have any moons?,"No, Mercury has zero moons."
What's the surface of Mercury like?,"It’s rocky, gray, and covered in thousands of craters from asteroid hits, just like our Moon."
Why does Mercury have so many craters?,"It has almost no air or atmosphere to burn up space rocks, so they crash right into it."
How hot does Mercury get during the day?,It can reach over 400°C (800°F) – hotter than an oven!
Why's Mercury so hot?,It’s very close to the Sun and the sunlight is super strong there.
How cold does Mercury get at night?,It can drop to -170°C (-280°F) – colder than a freezer!
Why does Mercury get so cold at night?,"It has almost no atmosphere to trap the heat, so all the warmth escapes into space."
How long is one day on Mercury?,One day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days – that’s a very long school day!
How long is one year on Mercury?,A year on Mercury is only 88 Earth days because it zooms around the Sun so fast.
Does Mercury have an atmosphere?,It has a very thin layer of gas called an exosphere – it’s almost like having no air at all.
Why can’t people breathe on Mercury?,"There’s almost no oxygen and the air is way too thin, hot, and full of radiation."
What color is Mercury?,"Mercury looks gray and rocky, a bit like the Moon."
Who was Mercury named after?,It was named after the speedy messenger of the Roman gods because it moves so fast across the sky.
Can we see Mercury from Earth without a telescope?,Yes! It’s sometimes visible just after sunset or before sunrise – it’s called the “evening star” or “morning star.”
What spacecraft have visited Mercury?,Two spacecraft: Mariner 10 in the 1970s and MESSENGER from 2004–2015.
What did MESSENGER discover?,"It found ice in deep craters near the poles that never see sunlight, even though Mercury is super hot!"
Is there ice on Mercury?,"Yes, hidden in shadowy craters at the north and south poles where the Sun never shines."
Why doesn’t the ice melt on Mercury?,"Those craters are always in shadow and super cold, and there’s no air to carry heat to them."
How fast does Mercury travel around the Sun?,It zooms at about 47 kilometers per second (29 miles per second) – the fastest planet!
Does Mercury have rings like Saturn?,"No, Mercury has no rings at all."
What's the biggest crater on Mercury?,It’s the Caloris Basin – so huge you could fit the whole state of Texas inside it!
Why's Mercury’s sky black even in daytime?,"It has almost no atmosphere to scatter sunlight, so the sky stays black and you can see stars during the day."
Can people ever live on Mercury?,"Probably not – it’s too hot, too cold, no air, and too much radiation from the Sun."
How many times could Mercury fit inside Earth?,About 18 Mercurys could fit inside Earth.
What's Mercury mostly made of?,It has a huge iron core (almost 75% of the planet) covered by a thin rocky layer.
Why does Mercury have such a big iron core?,"Scientists think a giant crash long ago knocked away most of the rocky outside, leaving the heavy iron."
Is Mercury shrinking?,"Yes! It’s slowly cooling inside and shrinking a tiny bit, making wrinkle-like cliffs."
What are those wrinkle cliffs called?,They’re called “scarps” or “lobate scarps.”
How long would it take to drive around Mercury in a car?,"If you drove 100 km/h without stopping, it would take about 60 Earth days to go all the way around."
Can you explain why Mercury has no seasons?,"Actually, Mercury has almost no tilt, so it doesn’t really have seasons like Earth."
Where's the hottest place on Mercury?,Right at the point facing the Sun at noon – it can get hotter than 430°C!
Where's the coldest place on Mercury?,In the bottoms of polar craters that never see sunlight.
Why does the Sun look bigger from Mercury?,"Because Mercury is closer to the Sun, the Sun appears almost three times bigger than from Earth."
What's Mercury’s gravity like compared to Earth?,It’s only about 38% of Earth’s gravity – you would weigh much less and could jump really high!
How many people have walked on Mercury?,Zero – no human has ever been there; only robots!
What's the brightest planet we see from Earth?,"Venus is usually brighter, but Mercury can look very bright when conditions are right."
Can you see Mercury during the day?,Very rarely and only with a telescope because the Sun is too bright.
Why does Mercury always show the same side to the Sun sometimes?,"Actually, it spins 3 times for every 2 orbits, so different parts get sunlight."
What's a transit of Mercury?,When Mercury passes directly between Earth and the Sun – it looks like a tiny black dot crossing the Sun.
How often do we study Mercury today?,Scientists use telescopes on Earth and data from the old MESSENGER mission.
Will we send another spacecraft to Mercury?,Yes! A mission called BepiColombo (from Europe and Japan) is on its way and will arrive in 2025–2026.

What's Venus?,Venus is the second planet from the Sun and the hottest planet in our Solar System.
Is Venus bigger or smaller than Earth?,Venus is almost the same size as Earth – it’s like Earth’s twin sister!
Why do we call Venus Earth’s twin?,"Because it’s almost the same size and made of rock, but it’s way too hot to live on."
How far is Venus from the Sun?,Venus is about 108 million kilometers (67 million miles) from the Sun.
How hot is Venus?,It’s over 460°C (860°F) all the time – hot enough to melt lead!
Why's Venus the hottest planet?,It has a super thick blanket of carbon dioxide gas that traps heat like a giant greenhouse.
What's the greenhouse effect on Venus?,"The thick atmosphere traps the Sun’s heat so it can’t escape, making the planet super toasty."
Does Venus have any moons?,"No, Venus has zero moons."

Why's Venus so bright from Earth?,"It’s covered in thick white clouds that reflect sunlight really well, and it comes quite close to Earth."
Can we see Venus without a telescope?,Yes! It’s often called the Evening Star or Morning Star because it shines so brightly.
What are the clouds on Venus made of?,"They’re made of sulfuric acid – like nasty, poisonous rain that never reaches the ground."
Does it rain on Venus?,"Yes, but the rain is sulfuric acid and it evaporates before hitting the ground."
What's the surface of Venus like?,"It’s rocky with thousands of volcanoes, huge lava plains, and mountains."
Are there active volcanoes on Venus?,Scientists think some might still be active – Venus is a very volcanic world!
How thick is Venus’s atmosphere?,It’s about 90 times thicker than Earth’s – it would crush you like the bottom of the ocean.
Can humans breathe on Venus?,No way! The air is mostly carbon dioxide and full of poisonous gases.
Who was Venus named after?,Venus was named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty because it looks so pretty in the sky.
How many spacecraft have landed on Venus?,Only Soviet spacecraft have landed – the Venera probes – and they melted quickly!
How long did the longest Venus lander survive?,The record is about 2 hours before the heat and pressure destroyed it.
Is there lightning on Venus?,Yes! Scientists have seen huge lightning storms in the thick clouds.
Why does Venus have almost no water?,The extreme heat long ago boiled all the water away into space.
Does Venus have craters?,Not many – lava from volcanoes covered most old craters.
What's the highest mountain on Venus?,Maxwell Montes – it’s taller than Mount Everest!
How strong is the wind on Venus?,"Near the ground it’s slow, but high in the clouds it blows over 350 km/h – faster than a hurricane!"
What's super-rotation on Venus?,The clouds go all the way around the planet in just 4 Earth days even though the planet spins slowly.
Is there ice on Venus?,No – it’s far too hot everywhere for ice.
What's Venus’s sky color if you stood there?,It would look orange-yellow because of the thick clouds.
Can people ever live on Venus?,"Not on the ground, but some scientists dream about floating cities high in the cooler clouds."

How often does a transit of Venus happen?,"Very rarely – they come in pairs 8 years apart, then wait over 100 years."
Does Venus have seasons?,"No, because it has almost no tilt – every day is the same."
Where's the pressure highest on Venus?,On the surface – it’s like being 900 meters under the ocean on Earth.
Why can’t we see the surface of Venus with normal telescopes?,The thick clouds hide everything – we need radar to see through them.
What spacecraft mapped Venus with radar?,The Magellan spacecraft in the 1990s made the best maps of the hidden surface.
Is Venus getting hotter or cooler?,It’s stayed about the same super-hot temperature for billions of years.
What's the Soviet Venera program?,A series of brave Russian probes that took the only photos ever from Venus’s surface.

How many Earth days equal one Mercury day at the equator?,"Because of the slow spin, one full day-night cycle is 176 Earth days."
Is Mercury a rocky planet or a gas planet?,"Mercury is a rocky (terrestrial) planet, like Earth, Venus, and Mars."
What would happen if you dropped a feather and a hammer on Mercury?,They would hit the ground at the same time (just like on the Moon) because there’s almost no air.
What is Mercury?,Mercury is the smallest planet in our Solar System and the closest planet to the Sun.
How far is Mercury from the Sun?,Mercury is about 58 million kilometers (36 million miles) from the Sun on average – much closer than Earth!
Why is Mercury the closest planet to the Sun?,It formed that way billions of years ago when the Solar System was born – it just happened to be the nearest one.
How big is Mercury compared to Earth?,"Mercury is much smaller – if Earth were the size of a basketball, Mercury would be like a tennis ball."
Does Mercury have any moons?,"No, Mercury has zero moons."
What is the surface of Mercury like?,"It’s rocky, gray, and covered in thousands of craters from asteroid hits, just like our Moon."
Why does Mercury have so many craters?,"It has almost no air or atmosphere to burn up space rocks, so they crash right into it."
How hot does Mercury get during the day?,It can reach over 400°C (800°F) – hotter than an oven!
Why is Mercury so hot?,It’s very close to the Sun and the sunlight is super strong there.
How cold does Mercury get at night?,It can drop to -170°C (-280°F) – colder than a freezer!
Why does Mercury get so cold at night?,"It has almost no atmosphere to trap the heat, so all the warmth escapes into space."
How long is one day on Mercury?,One day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days – that’s a very long school day!
How long is one year on Mercury?,A year on Mercury is only 88 Earth days because it zooms around the Sun so fast.
Does Mercury have an atmosphere?,It has a very thin layer of gas called an exosphere – it’s almost like having no air at all.
Why can’t people breathe on Mercury?,"There’s almost no oxygen and the air is way too thin, hot, and full of radiation."
What color is Mercury?,"Mercury looks gray and rocky, a bit like the Moon."
Who was Mercury named after?,It was named after the speedy messenger of the Roman gods because it moves so fast across the sky.
Can we see Mercury from Earth without a telescope?,Yes! It’s sometimes visible just after sunset or before sunrise – it’s called the “evening star” or “morning star.”
What spacecraft have visited Mercury?,Two spacecraft: Mariner 10 in the 1970s and MESSENGER from 2004–2015.
What did MESSENGER discover?,"It found ice in deep craters near the poles that never see sunlight, even though Mercury is super hot!"
Is there ice on Mercury?,"Yes, hidden in shadowy craters at the north and south poles where the Sun never shines."
Why doesn’t the ice melt on Mercury?,"Those craters are always in shadow and super cold, and there’s no air to carry heat to them."
How fast does Mercury travel around the Sun?,It zooms at about 47 kilometers per second (29 miles per second) – the fastest planet!
Does Mercury have rings like Saturn?,"No, Mercury has no rings at all."
What is the biggest crater on Mercury?,It’s the Caloris Basin – so huge you could fit the whole state of Texas inside it!
Why is Mercury’s sky black even in daytime?,"It has almost no atmosphere to scatter sunlight, so the sky stays black and you can see stars during the day."
Can people ever live on Mercury?,"Probably not – it’s too hot, too cold, no air, and too much radiation from the Sun."
How many times could Mercury fit inside Earth?,About 18 Mercurys could fit inside Earth.
What is Mercury mostly made of?,It has a huge iron core (almost 75% of the planet) covered by a thin rocky layer.
Why does Mercury have such a big iron core?,"Scientists think a giant crash long ago knocked away most of the rocky outside, leaving the heavy iron."
Is Mercury shrinking?,"Yes! It’s slowly cooling inside and shrinking a tiny bit, making wrinkle-like cliffs."
What are those wrinkle cliffs called?,They’re called “scarps” or “lobate scarps.”
How long would it take to drive around Mercury in a car?,"If you drove 100 km/h without stopping, it would take about 60 Earth days to go all the way around."
Can you explain why Mercury has no seasons?,"Actually, Mercury has almost no tilt, so it doesn’t really have seasons like Earth."
Where is the hottest place on Mercury?,Right at the point facing the Sun at noon – it can get hotter than 430°C!
Where is the coldest place on Mercury?,In the bottoms of polar craters that never see sunlight.
Why does the Sun look bigger from Mercury?,"Because Mercury is closer to the Sun, the Sun appears almost three times bigger than from Earth."
What is Mercury’s gravity like compared to Earth?,It’s only about 38% of Earth’s gravity – you would weigh much less and could jump really high!
How many people have walked on Mercury?,Zero – no human has ever been there; only robots!
What is the brightest planet we see from Earth?,"Venus is usually brighter, but Mercury can look very bright when conditions are right."
Can you see Mercury during the day?,Very rarely and only with a telescope because the Sun is too bright.
Why does Mercury always show the same side to the Sun sometimes?,"Actually, it spins 3 times for every 2 orbits, so different parts get sunlight."
What is a transit of Mercury?,When Mercury passes directly between Earth and the Sun – it looks like a tiny black dot crossing the Sun.
How often do we study Mercury today?,Scientists use telescopes on Earth and data from the old MESSENGER mission.
Will we send another spacecraft to Mercury?,Yes! A mission called BepiColombo (from Europe and Japan) is on its way and will arrive in 2025–2026.
What is special about Mercury’s orbit?,It’s the most oval (elliptical) orbit of any planet except Pluto.

What is the surface of Mercury like?,"It’s rocky, gray, and covered in thousands of craters from asteroid hits, just like our Moon."
Why does Mercury have so many craters?,"It has almost no air or atmosphere to burn up space rocks, so they crash right into it."
How hot does Mercury get during the day?,It can reach over 400°C (800°F) – hotter than an oven!
Why is Mercury so hot?,It’s very close to the Sun and the sunlight is super strong there.
How cold does Mercury get at night?,It can drop to -170°C (-280°F) – colder than a freezer!
Why does Mercury get so cold at night?,"It has almost no atmosphere to trap the heat, so all the warmth escapes into space."
How long is one day on Mercury?,One day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days – that’s a very long school day!
How long is one year on Mercury?,A year on Mercury is only 88 Earth days because it zooms around the Sun so fast.
Does Mercury have an atmosphere?,It has a very thin layer of gas called an exosphere – it’s almost like having no air at all.
Why can’t people breathe on Mercury?,"There’s almost no oxygen and the air is way too thin, hot, and full of radiation."
What color is Mercury?,"Mercury looks gray and rocky, a bit like the Moon."
Who was Mercury named after?,It was named after the speedy messenger of the Roman gods because it moves so fast across the sky.
Can we see Mercury from Earth without a telescope?,Yes! It’s sometimes visible just after sunset or before sunrise – it’s called the “evening star” or “morning star.”
What spacecraft have visited Mercury?,Two spacecraft: Mariner 10 in the 1970s and MESSENGER from 2004–2015.
What did MESSENGER discover?,"It found ice in deep craters near the poles that never see sunlight, even though Mercury is super hot!"
Is there ice on Mercury?,"Yes, hidden in shadowy craters at the north and south poles where the Sun never shines."
Why doesn’t the ice melt on Mercury?,"Those craters are always in shadow and super cold, and there’s no air to carry heat to them."
How fast does Mercury travel around the Sun?,It zooms at about 47 kilometers per second (29 miles per second) – the fastest planet!
Does Mercury have rings like Saturn?,"No, Mercury has no rings at all."
What is the biggest crater on Mercury?,It’s the Caloris Basin – so huge you could fit the whole state of Texas inside it!
Why is Mercury’s sky black even in daytime?,"It has almost no atmosphere to scatter sunlight, so the sky stays black and you can see stars during the day."
Can people ever live on Mercury?,"Probably not – it’s too hot, too cold, no air, and too much radiation from the Sun."
How many times could Mercury fit inside Earth?,About 18 Mercurys could fit inside Earth.
What is Mercury mostly made of?,It has a huge iron core (almost 75% of the planet) covered by a thin rocky layer.
Why does Mercury have such a big iron core?,"Scientists think a giant crash long ago knocked away most of the rocky outside, leaving the heavy iron."
Is Mercury shrinking?,"Yes! It’s slowly cooling inside and shrinking a tiny bit, making wrinkle-like cliffs."
What are those wrinkle cliffs called?,They’re called “scarps” or “lobate scarps.”
How long would it take to drive around Mercury in a car?,"If you drove 100 km/h without stopping, it would take about 60 Earth days to go all the way around."
Can you explain why Mercury has no seasons?,"Actually, Mercury has almost no tilt, so it doesn’t really have seasons like Earth."
Where is the hottest place on Mercury?,Right at the point facing the Sun at noon – it can get hotter than 430°C!
Where is the coldest place on Mercury?,In the bottoms of polar craters that never see sunlight.
Why does the Sun look bigger from Mercury?,"Because Mercury is closer to the Sun, the Sun appears almost three times bigger than from Earth."
What is Mercury’s gravity like compared to Earth?,It’s only about 38% of Earth’s gravity – you would weigh much less and could jump really high!
How many people have walked on Mercury?,Zero – no human has ever been there; only robots!
What is the brightest planet we see from Earth?,"Venus is usually brighter, but Mercury can look very bright when conditions are right."
Can you see Mercury during the day?,Very rarely and only with a telescope because the Sun is too bright.
Why does Mercury always show the same side to the Sun sometimes?,"Actually, it spins 3 times for every 2 orbits, so different parts get sunlight."
What is a transit of Mercury?,When Mercury passes directly between Earth and the Sun – it looks like a tiny black dot crossing the Sun.
How often do we study Mercury today?,Scientists use telescopes on Earth and data from the old MESSENGER mission.
Will we send another spacecraft to Mercury?,Yes! A mission called BepiColombo (from Europe and Japan) is on its way and will arrive in 2025–2026.
What is special about Mercury’s orbit?,It’s the most oval (elliptical) orbit of any planet except Pluto.
Why is it hard to send spacecraft to Mercury?,"The Sun’s gravity is so strong that spacecraft have to slow down a lot, which takes many fly-bys."
How many Earth days equal one Mercury day at the equator?,"Because of the slow spin, one full day-night cycle is 176 Earth days."
Is Mercury a rocky planet or a gas planet?,"Mercury is a rocky (terrestrial) planet, like Earth, Venus, and Mars."
What would happen if you dropped a feather and a hammer on Mercury?,They would hit the ground at the same time (just like on the Moon) because there’s almost no air.
What is Mercury?,Mercury is the smallest planet in our Solar System and the closest planet to the Sun.
How far is Mercury from the Sun?,Mercury is about 58 million kilometers (36 million miles) from the Sun on average – much closer than Earth!
Why is Mercury the closest planet to the Sun?,It formed that way billions of years ago when the Solar System was born – it just happened to be the nearest one.

What is a transit of Venus?,When Venus passes directly between Earth and the Sun – it looks like a small black dot on the Sun.
How often does a transit of Venus happen?,"Very rarely – they come in pairs 8 years apart, then wait over 100 years."
Does Venus have seasons?,"No, because it has almost no tilt – every day is the same."
Where is the pressure highest on Venus?,On the surface – it’s like being 900 meters under the ocean on Earth.
Why can’t we see the surface of Venus with normal telescopes?,The thick clouds hide everything – we need radar to see through them.
What spacecraft mapped Venus with radar?,The Magellan spacecraft in the 1990s made the best maps of the hidden surface.
Is Venus getting hotter or cooler?,It’s stayed about the same super-hot temperature for billions of years.
What is the Soviet Venera program?,A series of brave Russian probes that took the only photos ever from Venus’s surface.
Can you see stars from Venus during the day?,No – the thick clouds make the sky bright all the time.
Why does Venus shine so long in the evening?,"It follows the Sun down or comes up before the Sun, so we can see it for hours."
Does Venus have earthquakes?,They’re called venusquakes – the ground sometimes shakes from shrinking or volcanoes.
How many volcanoes are on Venus?,"Over 1,600 big ones have been counted, and probably millions of small ones!"

What's the brightest planet we see from Earth?,"Venus is usually brighter, but Mercury can look very bright when conditions are right."
Can you see Mercury during the day?,Very rarely and only with a telescope because the Sun is too bright.
Why does Mercury always show the same side to the Sun sometimes?,"Actually, it spins 3 times for every 2 orbits, so different parts get sunlight."
What's a transit of Mercury?,When Mercury passes directly between Earth and the Sun – it looks like a tiny black dot crossing the Sun.
How often do we study Mercury today?,Scientists use telescopes on Earth and data from the old MESSENGER mission.
Will we send another spacecraft to Mercury?,Yes! A mission called BepiColombo (from Europe and Japan) is on its way and will arrive in 2025–2026.
What's special about Mercury’s orbit?,It’s the most oval (elliptical) orbit of any planet except Pluto.
Why's it hard to send spacecraft to Mercury?,"The Sun’s gravity is so strong that spacecraft have to slow down a lot, which takes many fly-bys."
How many Earth days equal one Mercury day at the equator?,"Because of the slow spin, one full day-night cycle is 176 Earth days."
Is Mercury a rocky planet or a gas planet?,"Mercury is a rocky (terrestrial) planet, like Earth, Venus, and Mars."
What would happen if you dropped a feather and a hammer on Mercury?,They would hit the ground at the same time (just like on the Moon) because there’s almost no air.
What's Mercury?,Mercury is the smallest planet in our Solar System and the closest planet to the Sun.
How far is Mercury from the Sun?,Mercury is about 58 million kilometers (36 million miles) from the Sun on average – much closer than Earth!
Why's Mercury the closest planet to the Sun?,It formed that way billions of years ago when the Solar System was born – it just happened to be the nearest one.
How big is Mercury compared to Earth?,"Mercury is much smaller – if Earth were the size of a basketball, Mercury would be like a tennis ball."
Does Mercury have any moons?,"No, Mercury has zero moons."
What's the surface of Mercury like?,"It’s rocky, gray, and covered in thousands of craters from asteroid hits, just like our Moon."
Why does Mercury have so many craters?,"It has almost no air or atmosphere to burn up space rocks, so they crash right into it."
How hot does Mercury get during the day?,It can reach over 400°C (800°F) – hotter than an oven!
Why's Mercury so hot?,It’s very close to the Sun and the sunlight is super strong there.
How cold does Mercury get at night?,It can drop to -170°C (-280°F) – colder than a freezer!
Why does Mercury get so cold at night?,"It has almost no atmosphere to trap the heat, so all the warmth escapes into space."
How long is one day on Mercury?,One day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days – that’s a very long school day!
How long is one year on Mercury?,A year on Mercury is only 88 Earth days because it zooms around the Sun so fast.
Does Mercury have an atmosphere?,It has a very thin layer of gas called an exosphere – it’s almost like having no air at all.
Why can’t people breathe on Mercury?,"There’s almost no oxygen and the air is way too thin, hot, and full of radiation."
What color is Mercury?,"Mercury looks gray and rocky, a bit like the Moon."
Who was Mercury named after?,It was named after the speedy messenger of the Roman gods because it moves so fast across the sky.
Can we see Mercury from Earth without a telescope?,Yes! It’s sometimes visible just after sunset or before sunrise – it’s called the “evening star” or “morning star.”
What spacecraft have visited Mercury?,Two spacecraft: Mariner 10 in the 1970s and MESSENGER from 2004–2015.
What did MESSENGER discover?,"It found ice in deep craters near the poles that never see sunlight, even though Mercury is super hot!"
Is there ice on Mercury?,"Yes, hidden in shadowy craters at the north and south poles where the Sun never shines."
Why doesn’t the ice melt on Mercury?,"Those craters are always in shadow and super cold, and there’s no air to carry heat to them."
How fast does Mercury travel around the Sun?,It zooms at about 47 kilometers per second (29 miles per second) – the fastest planet!
Does Mercury have rings like Saturn?,"No, Mercury has no rings at all."
What's the biggest crater on Mercury?,It’s the Caloris Basin – so huge you could fit the whole state of Texas inside it!
Why's Mercury’s sky black even in daytime?,"It has almost no atmosphere to scatter sunlight, so the sky stays black and you can see stars during the day."
Can people ever live on Mercury?,"Probably not – it’s too hot, too cold, no air, and too much radiation from the Sun."
How many times could Mercury fit inside Earth?,About 18 Mercurys could fit inside Earth.
What's Mercury mostly made of?,It has a huge iron core (almost 75% of the planet) covered by a thin rocky layer.
Why does Mercury have such a big iron core?,"Scientists think a giant crash long ago knocked away most of the rocky outside, leaving the heavy iron."
Is Mercury shrinking?,"Yes! It’s slowly cooling inside and shrinking a tiny bit, making wrinkle-like cliffs."
What are those wrinkle cliffs called?,They’re called “scarps” or “lobate scarps.”
How long would it take to drive around Mercury in a car?,"If you drove 100 km/h without stopping, it would take about 60 Earth days to go all the way around."
Can you explain why Mercury has no seasons?,"Actually, Mercury has almost no tilt, so it doesn’t really have seasons like Earth."
Where's the hottest place on Mercury?,Right at the point facing the Sun at noon – it can get hotter than 430°C!
Where's the coldest place on Mercury?,In the bottoms of polar craters that never see sunlight.
Why does the Sun look bigger from Mercury?,"Because Mercury is closer to the Sun, the Sun appears almost three times bigger than from Earth."
What's Mercury’s gravity like compared to Earth?,It’s only about 38% of Earth’s gravity – you would weigh much less and could jump really high!

Will we send another spacecraft to Mercury?,Yes! A mission called BepiColombo (from Europe and Japan) is on its way and will arrive in 2025–2026.
What's special about Mercury’s orbit?,It’s the most oval (elliptical) orbit of any planet except Pluto.
Why's it hard to send spacecraft to Mercury?,"The Sun’s gravity is so strong that spacecraft have to slow down a lot, which takes many fly-bys."
How many Earth days equal one Mercury day at the equator?,"Because of the slow spin, one full day-night cycle is 176 Earth days."
Is Mercury a rocky planet or a gas planet?,"Mercury is a rocky (terrestrial) planet, like Earth, Venus, and Mars."
What would happen if you dropped a feather and a hammer on Mercury?,They would hit the ground at the same time (just like on the Moon) because there’s almost no air.
What's Mercury?,Mercury is the smallest planet in our Solar System and the closest planet to the Sun.
How far is Mercury from the Sun?,Mercury is about 58 million kilometers (36 million miles) from the Sun on average – much closer than Earth!
Why's Mercury the closest planet to the Sun?,It formed that way billions of years ago when the Solar System was born – it just happened to be the nearest one.
How big is Mercury compared to Earth?,"Mercury is much smaller – if Earth were the size of a basketball, Mercury would be like a tennis ball."
Does Mercury have any moons?,"No, Mercury has zero moons."
What's the surface of Mercury like?,"It’s rocky, gray, and covered in thousands of craters from asteroid hits, just like our Moon."
Why does Mercury have so many craters?,"It has almost no air or atmosphere to burn up space rocks, so they crash right into it."
How hot does Mercury get during the day?,It can reach over 400°C (800°F) – hotter than an oven!
Why's Mercury so hot?,It’s very close to the Sun and the sunlight is super strong there.
How cold does Mercury get at night?,It can drop to -170°C (-280°F) – colder than a freezer!
Why does Mercury get so cold at night?,"It has almost no atmosphere to trap the heat, so all the warmth escapes into space."
How long is one day on Mercury?,One day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days – that’s a very long school day!
How long is one year on Mercury?,A year on Mercury is only 88 Earth days because it zooms around the Sun so fast.
Does Mercury have an atmosphere?,It has a very thin layer of gas called an exosphere – it’s almost like having no air at all.
Why can’t people breathe on Mercury?,"There’s almost no oxygen and the air is way too thin, hot, and full of radiation."
What color is Mercury?,"Mercury looks gray and rocky, a bit like the Moon."
Who was Mercury named after?,It was named after the speedy messenger of the Roman gods because it moves so fast across the sky.
Can we see Mercury from Earth without a telescope?,Yes! It’s sometimes visible just after sunset or before sunrise – it’s called the “evening star” or “morning star.”
What spacecraft have visited Mercury?,Two spacecraft: Mariner 10 in the 1970s and MESSENGER from 2004–2015.
What did MESSENGER discover?,"It found ice in deep craters near the poles that never see sunlight, even though Mercury is super hot!"
Is there ice on Mercury?,"Yes, hidden in shadowy craters at the north and south poles where the Sun never shines."
Why doesn’t the ice melt on Mercury?,"Those craters are always in shadow and super cold, and there’s no air to carry heat to them."
How fast does Mercury travel around the Sun?,It zooms at about 47 kilometers per second (29 miles per second) – the fastest planet!
Does Mercury have rings like Saturn?,"No, Mercury has no rings at all."
What's the biggest crater on Mercury?,It’s the Caloris Basin – so huge you could fit the whole state of Texas inside it!
Why's Mercury’s sky black even in daytime?,"It has almost no atmosphere to scatter sunlight, so the sky stays black and you can see stars during the day."
Can people ever live on Mercury?,"Probably not – it’s too hot, too cold, no air, and too much radiation from the Sun."
How many times could Mercury fit inside Earth?,About 18 Mercurys could fit inside Earth.
What's Mercury mostly made of?,It has a huge iron core (almost 75% of the planet) covered by a thin rocky layer.
Why does Mercury have such a big iron core?,"Scientists think a giant crash long ago knocked away most of the rocky outside, leaving the heavy iron."
Is Mercury shrinking?,"Yes! It’s slowly cooling inside and shrinking a tiny bit, making wrinkle-like cliffs."
What are those wrinkle cliffs called?,They’re called “scarps” or “lobate scarps.”
How long would it take to drive around Mercury in a car?,"If you drove 100 km/h without stopping, it would take about 60 Earth days to go all the way around."
Can you explain why Mercury has no seasons?,"Actually, Mercury has almost no tilt, so it doesn’t really have seasons like Earth."
Where's the hottest place on Mercury?,Right at the point facing the Sun at noon – it can get hotter than 430°C!
Where's the coldest place on Mercury?,In the bottoms of polar craters that never see sunlight.
Why does the Sun look bigger from Mercury?,"Because Mercury is closer to the Sun, the Sun appears almost three times bigger than from Earth."
What's Mercury’s gravity like compared to Earth?,It’s only about 38% of Earth’s gravity – you would weigh much less and could jump really high!
How many people have walked on Mercury?,Zero – no human has ever been there; only robots!
What's the brightest planet we see from Earth?,"Venus is usually brighter, but Mercury can look very bright when conditions are right."
Can you see Mercury during the day?,Very rarely and only with a telescope because the Sun is too bright.
Why does Mercury always show the same side to the Sun sometimes?,"Actually, it spins 3 times for every 2 orbits, so different parts get sunlight."
What's a transit of Mercury?,When Mercury passes directly between Earth and the Sun – it looks like a tiny black dot crossing the Sun.

What's a transit of Venus?,When Venus passes directly between Earth and the Sun – it looks like a small black dot on the Sun.
How often does a transit of Venus happen?,"Very rarely – they come in pairs 8 years apart, then wait over 100 years."
Does Venus have seasons?,"No, because it has almost no tilt – every day is the same."
Where's the pressure highest on Venus?,On the surface – it’s like being 900 meters under the ocean on Earth.
Why can’t we see the surface of Venus with normal telescopes?,The thick clouds hide everything – we need radar to see through them.
What spacecraft mapped Venus with radar?,The Magellan spacecraft in the 1990s made the best maps of the hidden surface.
Is Venus getting hotter or cooler?,It’s stayed about the same super-hot temperature for billions of years.
What's the Soviet Venera program?,A series of brave Russian probes that took the only photos ever from Venus’s surface.
Can you see stars from Venus during the day?,No – the thick clouds make the sky bright all the time.
Why does Venus shine so long in the evening?,"It follows the Sun down or comes up before the Sun, so we can see it for hours."
Does Venus have earthquakes?,They’re called venusquakes – the ground sometimes shakes from shrinking or volcanoes.

What's special about Venus’s day being longer than its year?,It’s the only planet where a day lasts longer than a year – very strange!
Why's Venus sometimes called Earth’s evil twin?,Because it’s almost the same size but turned into a deadly hot hell instead of a nice home.
What's Venus?,Venus is the second planet from the Sun and the hottest planet in our Solar System.
Is Venus bigger or smaller than Earth?,Venus is almost the same size as Earth – it’s like Earth’s twin sister!

What is special about Mercury’s orbit?,It’s the most oval (elliptical) orbit of any planet except Pluto.
Why is it hard to send spacecraft to Mercury?,"The Sun’s gravity is so strong that spacecraft have to slow down a lot, which takes many fly-bys."
How many Earth days equal one Mercury day at the equator?,"Because of the slow spin, one full day-night cycle is 176 Earth days."
Is Mercury a rocky planet or a gas planet?,"Mercury is a rocky (terrestrial) planet, like Earth, Venus, and Mars."
What would happen if you dropped a feather and a hammer on Mercury?,They would hit the ground at the same time (just like on the Moon) because there’s almost no air.
What is Mercury?,Mercury is the smallest planet in our Solar System and the closest planet to the Sun.
How far is Mercury from the Sun?,Mercury is about 58 million kilometers (36 million miles) from the Sun on average – much closer than Earth!
Why is Mercury the closest planet to the Sun?,It formed that way billions of years ago when the Solar System was born – it just happened to be the nearest one.
How big is Mercury compared to Earth?,"Mercury is much smaller – if Earth were the size of a basketball, Mercury would be like a tennis ball."
Does Mercury have any moons?,"No, Mercury has zero moons."
What is the surface of Mercury like?,"It’s rocky, gray, and covered in thousands of craters from asteroid hits, just like our Moon."
Why does Mercury have so many craters?,"It has almost no air or atmosphere to burn up space rocks, so they crash right into it."
How hot does Mercury get during the day?,It can reach over 400°C (800°F) – hotter than an oven!
Why is Mercury so hot?,It’s very close to the Sun and the sunlight is super strong there.
How cold does Mercury get at night?,It can drop to -170°C (-280°F) – colder than a freezer!
Why does Mercury get so cold at night?,"It has almost no atmosphere to trap the heat, so all the warmth escapes into space."
How long is one day on Mercury?,One day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days – that’s a very long school day!
How long is one year on Mercury?,A year on Mercury is only 88 Earth days because it zooms around the Sun so fast.
Does Mercury have an atmosphere?,It has a very thin layer of gas called an exosphere – it’s almost like having no air at all.
Why can’t people breathe on Mercury?,"There’s almost no oxygen and the air is way too thin, hot, and full of radiation."
What color is Mercury?,"Mercury looks gray and rocky, a bit like the Moon."
Who was Mercury named after?,It was named after the speedy messenger of the Roman gods because it moves so fast across the sky.
Can we see Mercury from Earth without a telescope?,Yes! It’s sometimes visible just after sunset or before sunrise – it’s called the “evening star” or “morning star.”
What spacecraft have visited Mercury?,Two spacecraft: Mariner 10 in the 1970s and MESSENGER from 2004–2015.
What did MESSENGER discover?,"It found ice in deep craters near the poles that never see sunlight, even though Mercury is super hot!"
Is there ice on Mercury?,"Yes, hidden in shadowy craters at the north and south poles where the Sun never shines."
Why doesn’t the ice melt on Mercury?,"Those craters are always in shadow and super cold, and there’s no air to carry heat to them."
How fast does Mercury travel around the Sun?,It zooms at about 47 kilometers per second (29 miles per second) – the fastest planet!
Does Mercury have rings like Saturn?,"No, Mercury has no rings at all."
What is the biggest crater on Mercury?,It’s the Caloris Basin – so huge you could fit the whole state of Texas inside it!
Why is Mercury’s sky black even in daytime?,"It has almost no atmosphere to scatter sunlight, so the sky stays black and you can see stars during the day."
Can people ever live on Mercury?,"Probably not – it’s too hot, too cold, no air, and too much radiation from the Sun."
How many times could Mercury fit inside Earth?,About 18 Mercurys could fit inside Earth.
What is Mercury mostly made of?,It has a huge iron core (almost 75% of the planet) covered by a thin rocky layer.
Why does Mercury have such a big iron core?,"Scientists think a giant crash long ago knocked away most of the rocky outside, leaving the heavy iron."
Is Mercury shrinking?,"Yes! It’s slowly cooling inside and shrinking a tiny bit, making wrinkle-like cliffs."
What are those wrinkle cliffs called?,They’re called “scarps” or “lobate scarps.”
How long would it take to drive around Mercury in a car?,"If you drove 100 km/h without stopping, it would take about 60 Earth days to go all the way around."
Can you explain why Mercury has no seasons?,"Actually, Mercury has almost no tilt, so it doesn’t really have seasons like Earth."
Where is the hottest place on Mercury?,Right at the point facing the Sun at noon – it can get hotter than 430°C!
Where is the coldest place on Mercury?,In the bottoms of polar craters that never see sunlight.
Why does the Sun look bigger from Mercury?,"Because Mercury is closer to the Sun, the Sun appears almost three times bigger than from Earth."
What is Mercury’s gravity like compared to Earth?,It’s only about 38% of Earth’s gravity – you would weigh much less and could jump really high!
How many people have walked on Mercury?,Zero – no human has ever been there; only robots!
What is the brightest planet we see from Earth?,"Venus is usually brighter, but Mercury can look very bright when conditions are right."
Can you see Mercury during the day?,Very rarely and only with a telescope because the Sun is too bright.
Why does Mercury always show the same side to the Sun sometimes?,"Actually, it spins 3 times for every 2 orbits, so different parts get sunlight."
What is a transit of Mercury?,When Mercury passes directly between Earth and the Sun – it looks like a tiny black dot crossing the Sun.
How often do we study Mercury today?,Scientists use telescopes on Earth and data from the old MESSENGER mission.
Will we send another spacecraft to Mercury?,Yes! A mission called BepiColombo (from Europe and Japan) is on its way and will arrive in 2025–2026.

Why is Mercury the closest planet to the Sun?,It formed that way billions of years ago when the Solar System was born – it just happened to be the nearest one.
How big is Mercury compared to Earth?,"Mercury is much smaller – if Earth were the size of a basketball, Mercury would be like a tennis ball."
Does Mercury have any moons?,"No, Mercury has zero moons."
What is the surface of Mercury like?,"It’s rocky, gray, and covered in thousands of craters from asteroid hits, just like our Moon."
Why does Mercury have so many craters?,"It has almost no air or atmosphere to burn up space rocks, so they crash right into it."
How hot does Mercury get during the day?,It can reach over 400°C (800°F) – hotter than an oven!
Why is Mercury so hot?,It’s very close to the Sun and the sunlight is super strong there.
How cold does Mercury get at night?,It can drop to -170°C (-280°F) – colder than a freezer!
Why does Mercury get so cold at night?,"It has almost no atmosphere to trap the heat, so all the warmth escapes into space."
How long is one day on Mercury?,One day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days – that’s a very long school day!
How long is one year on Mercury?,A year on Mercury is only 88 Earth days because it zooms around the Sun so fast.
Does Mercury have an atmosphere?,It has a very thin layer of gas called an exosphere – it’s almost like having no air at all.
Why can’t people breathe on Mercury?,"There’s almost no oxygen and the air is way too thin, hot, and full of radiation."
What color is Mercury?,"Mercury looks gray and rocky, a bit like the Moon."
Who was Mercury named after?,It was named after the speedy messenger of the Roman gods because it moves so fast across the sky.
Can we see Mercury from Earth without a telescope?,Yes! It’s sometimes visible just after sunset or before sunrise – it’s called the “evening star” or “morning star.”
What spacecraft have visited Mercury?,Two spacecraft: Mariner 10 in the 1970s and MESSENGER from 2004–2015.
What did MESSENGER discover?,"It found ice in deep craters near the poles that never see sunlight, even though Mercury is super hot!"
Is there ice on Mercury?,"Yes, hidden in shadowy craters at the north and south poles where the Sun never shines."
Why doesn’t the ice melt on Mercury?,"Those craters are always in shadow and super cold, and there’s no air to carry heat to them."
How fast does Mercury travel around the Sun?,It zooms at about 47 kilometers per second (29 miles per second) – the fastest planet!
Does Mercury have rings like Saturn?,"No, Mercury has no rings at all."
What is the biggest crater on Mercury?,It’s the Caloris Basin – so huge you could fit the whole state of Texas inside it!
Why is Mercury’s sky black even in daytime?,"It has almost no atmosphere to scatter sunlight, so the sky stays black and you can see stars during the day."
Can people ever live on Mercury?,"Probably not – it’s too hot, too cold, no air, and too much radiation from the Sun."
How many times could Mercury fit inside Earth?,About 18 Mercurys could fit inside Earth.
What is Mercury mostly made of?,It has a huge iron core (almost 75% of the planet) covered by a thin rocky layer.
Why does Mercury have such a big iron core?,"Scientists think a giant crash long ago knocked away most of the rocky outside, leaving the heavy iron."
Is Mercury shrinking?,"Yes! It’s slowly cooling inside and shrinking a tiny bit, making wrinkle-like cliffs."
What are those wrinkle cliffs called?,They’re called “scarps” or “lobate scarps.”
How long would it take to drive around Mercury in a car?,"If you drove 100 km/h without stopping, it would take about 60 Earth days to go all the way around."
Can you explain why Mercury has no seasons?,"Actually, Mercury has almost no tilt, so it doesn’t really have seasons like Earth."
Where is the hottest place on Mercury?,Right at the point facing the Sun at noon – it can get hotter than 430°C!
Where is the coldest place on Mercury?,In the bottoms of polar craters that never see sunlight.
Why does the Sun look bigger from Mercury?,"Because Mercury is closer to the Sun, the Sun appears almost three times bigger than from Earth."
What is Mercury’s gravity like compared to Earth?,It’s only about 38% of Earth’s gravity – you would weigh much less and could jump really high!
How many people have walked on Mercury?,Zero – no human has ever been there; only robots!
What is the brightest planet we see from Earth?,"Venus is usually brighter, but Mercury can look very bright when conditions are right."
Can you see Mercury during the day?,Very rarely and only with a telescope because the Sun is too bright.
Why does Mercury always show the same side to the Sun sometimes?,"Actually, it spins 3 times for every 2 orbits, so different parts get sunlight."
What is a transit of Mercury?,When Mercury passes directly between Earth and the Sun – it looks like a tiny black dot crossing the Sun.
How often do we study Mercury today?,Scientists use telescopes on Earth and data from the old MESSENGER mission.
Will we send another spacecraft to Mercury?,Yes! A mission called BepiColombo (from Europe and Japan) is on its way and will arrive in 2025–2026.
What is special about Mercury’s orbit?,It’s the most oval (elliptical) orbit of any planet except Pluto.
Why is it hard to send spacecraft to Mercury?,"The Sun’s gravity is so strong that spacecraft have to slow down a lot, which takes many fly-bys."
How many Earth days equal one Mercury day at the equator?,"Because of the slow spin, one full day-night cycle is 176 Earth days."
Is Mercury a rocky planet or a gas planet?,"Mercury is a rocky (terrestrial) planet, like Earth, Venus, and Mars."
What would happen if you dropped a feather and a hammer on Mercury?,They would hit the ground at the same time (just like on the Moon) because there’s almost no air.

What is Venus?,Venus is the second planet from the Sun and the hottest planet in our Solar System.
Is Venus bigger or smaller than Earth?,Venus is almost the same size as Earth – it’s like Earth’s twin sister!
Why do we call Venus Earth’s twin?,"Because it’s almost the same size and made of rock, but it’s way too hot to live on."
How far is Venus from the Sun?,Venus is about 108 million kilometers (67 million miles) from the Sun.
How hot is Venus?,It’s over 460°C (860°F) all the time – hot enough to melt lead!
Why is Venus the hottest planet?,It has a super thick blanket of carbon dioxide gas that traps heat like a giant greenhouse.
What is the greenhouse effect on Venus?,"The thick atmosphere traps the Sun’s heat so it can’t escape, making the planet super toasty."
Does Venus have any moons?,"No, Venus has zero moons."
How long is one day on Venus?,One day on Venus (sunrise to sunrise) lasts 243 Earth days – longer than its year!
How long is a year on Venus?,A year on Venus is 225 Earth days – shorter than on Earth.
Why does Venus spin backwards?,Venus spins the opposite way from most planets – on Venus the Sun rises in the west!
What color is Venus in the sky?,Venus is bright white-yellow and is the brightest thing in the sky after the Sun and Moon.
Why is Venus so bright from Earth?,"It’s covered in thick white clouds that reflect sunlight really well, and it comes quite close to Earth."
Can we see Venus without a telescope?,Yes! It’s often called the Evening Star or Morning Star because it shines so brightly.
What are the clouds on Venus made of?,"They’re made of sulfuric acid – like nasty, poisonous rain that never reaches the ground."
Does it rain on Venus?,"Yes, but the rain is sulfuric acid and it evaporates before hitting the ground."
What is the surface of Venus like?,"It’s rocky with thousands of volcanoes, huge lava plains, and mountains."
Are there active volcanoes on Venus?,Scientists think some might still be active – Venus is a very volcanic world!
How thick is Venus’s atmosphere?,It’s about 90 times thicker than Earth’s – it would crush you like the bottom of the ocean.
Can humans breathe on Venus?,No way! The air is mostly carbon dioxide and full of poisonous gases.
Who was Venus named after?,Venus was named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty because it looks so pretty in the sky.
How many spacecraft have landed on Venus?,Only Soviet spacecraft have landed – the Venera probes – and they melted quickly!
How long did the longest Venus lander survive?,The record is about 2 hours before the heat and pressure destroyed it.
Is there lightning on Venus?,Yes! Scientists have seen huge lightning storms in the thick clouds.
Why does Venus have almost no water?,The extreme heat long ago boiled all the water away into space.
Does Venus have craters?,Not many – lava from volcanoes covered most old craters.
What is the highest mountain on Venus?,Maxwell Montes – it’s taller than Mount Everest!
How strong is the wind on Venus?,"Near the ground it’s slow, but high in the clouds it blows over 350 km/h – faster than a hurricane!"
What is super-rotation on Venus?,The clouds go all the way around the planet in just 4 Earth days even though the planet spins slowly.
Is there ice on Venus?,No – it’s far too hot everywhere for ice.
What is Venus’s sky color if you stood there?,It would look orange-yellow because of the thick clouds.
Can people ever live on Venus?,"Not on the ground, but some scientists dream about floating cities high in the cooler clouds."
How much would you weigh on Venus?,Almost the same as on Earth because it’s nearly the same size and gravity.
What is a transit of Venus?,When Venus passes directly between Earth and the Sun – it looks like a small black dot on the Sun.
How often does a transit of Venus happen?,"Very rarely – they come in pairs 8 years apart, then wait over 100 years."
Does Venus have seasons?,"No, because it has almost no tilt – every day is the same."
Where is the pressure highest on Venus?,On the surface – it’s like being 900 meters under the ocean on Earth.
Why can’t we see the surface of Venus with normal telescopes?,The thick clouds hide everything – we need radar to see through them.
What spacecraft mapped Venus with radar?,The Magellan spacecraft in the 1990s made the best maps of the hidden surface.
Is Venus getting hotter or cooler?,It’s stayed about the same super-hot temperature for billions of years.
What is the Soviet Venera program?,A series of brave Russian probes that took the only photos ever from Venus’s surface.
Can you see stars from Venus during the day?,No – the thick clouds make the sky bright all the time.
Why does Venus shine so long in the evening?,"It follows the Sun down or comes up before the Sun, so we can see it for hours."
Does Venus have earthquakes?,They’re called venusquakes – the ground sometimes shakes from shrinking or volcanoes.
How many volcanoes are on Venus?,"Over 1,600 big ones have been counted, and probably millions of small ones!"
Is Venus a rocky planet?,"Yes, it’s a rocky terrestrial planet just like Earth, Mercury, and Mars."
What would happen if you took off your spacesuit on Venus?,"You’d be crushed, burned, and poisoned all at once in seconds!"
Will we go back to Venus soon?,Yes! NASA and Europe are planning new missions like VERITAS and EnVision for the 2030s.
What is special about Venus’s day being longer than its year?,It’s the only planet where a day lasts longer than a year – very strange!
Why is Venus sometimes called Earth’s evil twin?,Because it’s almost the same size but turned into a deadly hot hell instead of a nice home.
What is Venus?,Venus is the second planet from the Sun and the hottest planet in our Solar System.
Is Venus bigger or smaller than Earth?,Venus is almost the same size as Earth – it’s like Earth’s twin sister!

Can people ever live on Mercury?,"Probably not – it’s too hot, too cold, no air, and too much radiation from the Sun."
How many times could Mercury fit inside Earth?,About 18 Mercurys could fit inside Earth.
What's Mercury mostly made of?,It has a huge iron core (almost 75% of the planet) covered by a thin rocky layer.
Why does Mercury have such a big iron core?,"Scientists think a giant crash long ago knocked away most of the rocky outside, leaving the heavy iron."
Is Mercury shrinking?,"Yes! It’s slowly cooling inside and shrinking a tiny bit, making wrinkle-like cliffs."
What are those wrinkle cliffs called?,They’re called “scarps” or “lobate scarps.”
How long would it take to drive around Mercury in a car?,"If you drove 100 km/h without stopping, it would take about 60 Earth days to go all the way around."
Can you explain why Mercury has no seasons?,"Actually, Mercury has almost no tilt, so it doesn’t really have seasons like Earth."
Where's the hottest place on Mercury?,Right at the point facing the Sun at noon – it can get hotter than 430°C!
Where's the coldest place on Mercury?,In the bottoms of polar craters that never see sunlight.
Why does the Sun look bigger from Mercury?,"Because Mercury is closer to the Sun, the Sun appears almost three times bigger than from Earth."
What's Mercury’s gravity like compared to Earth?,It’s only about 38% of Earth’s gravity – you would weigh much less and could jump really high!
How many people have walked on Mercury?,Zero – no human has ever been there; only robots!
What's the brightest planet we see from Earth?,"Venus is usually brighter, but Mercury can look very bright when conditions are right."
Can you see Mercury during the day?,Very rarely and only with a telescope because the Sun is too bright.
Why does Mercury always show the same side to the Sun sometimes?,"Actually, it spins 3 times for every 2 orbits, so different parts get sunlight."
What's a transit of Mercury?,When Mercury passes directly between Earth and the Sun – it looks like a tiny black dot crossing the Sun.
How often do we study Mercury today?,Scientists use telescopes on Earth and data from the old MESSENGER mission.
Will we send another spacecraft to Mercury?,Yes! A mission called BepiColombo (from Europe and Japan) is on its way and will arrive in 2025–2026.
What's special about Mercury’s orbit?,It’s the most oval (elliptical) orbit of any planet except Pluto.
Why's it hard to send spacecraft to Mercury?,"The Sun’s gravity is so strong that spacecraft have to slow down a lot, which takes many fly-bys."
How many Earth days equal one Mercury day at the equator?,"Because of the slow spin, one full day-night cycle is 176 Earth days."
Is Mercury a rocky planet or a gas planet?,"Mercury is a rocky (terrestrial) planet, like Earth, Venus, and Mars."
What would happen if you dropped a feather and a hammer on Mercury?,They would hit the ground at the same time (just like on the Moon) because there’s almost no air.

Why does the Sun look bigger from Mercury?,"Because Mercury is closer to the Sun, the Sun appears almost three times bigger than from Earth."
What's Mercury’s gravity like compared to Earth?,It’s only about 38% of Earth’s gravity – you would weigh much less and could jump really high!
How many people have walked on Mercury?,Zero – no human has ever been there; only robots!
What's the brightest planet we see from Earth?,"Venus is usually brighter, but Mercury can look very bright when conditions are right."
Can you see Mercury during the day?,Very rarely and only with a telescope because the Sun is too bright.
Why does Mercury always show the same side to the Sun sometimes?,"Actually, it spins 3 times for every 2 orbits, so different parts get sunlight."
What's a transit of Mercury?,When Mercury passes directly between Earth and the Sun – it looks like a tiny black dot crossing the Sun.
How often do we study Mercury today?,Scientists use telescopes on Earth and data from the old MESSENGER mission.
Will we send another spacecraft to Mercury?,Yes! A mission called BepiColombo (from Europe and Japan) is on its way and will arrive in 2025–2026.
What's special about Mercury’s orbit?,It’s the most oval (elliptical) orbit of any planet except Pluto.
Why's it hard to send spacecraft to Mercury?,"The Sun’s gravity is so strong that spacecraft have to slow down a lot, which takes many fly-bys."
How many Earth days equal one Mercury day at the equator?,"Because of the slow spin, one full day-night cycle is 176 Earth days."
Is Mercury a rocky planet or a gas planet?,"Mercury is a rocky (terrestrial) planet, like Earth, Venus, and Mars."
What would happen if you dropped a feather and a hammer on Mercury?,They would hit the ground at the same time (just like on the Moon) because there’s almost no air.
What's Mercury?,Mercury is the smallest planet in our Solar System and the closest planet to the Sun.
How far is Mercury from the Sun?,Mercury is about 58 million kilometers (36 million miles) from the Sun on average – much closer than Earth!
Why's Mercury the closest planet to the Sun?,It formed that way billions of years ago when the Solar System was born – it just happened to be the nearest one.
How big is Mercury compared to Earth?,"Mercury is much smaller – if Earth were the size of a basketball, Mercury would be like a tennis ball."
Does Mercury have any moons?,"No, Mercury has zero moons."
What's the surface of Mercury like?,"It’s rocky, gray, and covered in thousands of craters from asteroid hits, just like our Moon."
Why does Mercury have so many craters?,"It has almost no air or atmosphere to burn up space rocks, so they crash right into it."
How hot does Mercury get during the day?,It can reach over 400°C (800°F) – hotter than an oven!
Why's Mercury so hot?,It’s very close to the Sun and the sunlight is super strong there.
How cold does Mercury get at night?,It can drop to -170°C (-280°F) – colder than a freezer!
Why does Mercury get so cold at night?,"It has almost no atmosphere to trap the heat, so all the warmth escapes into space."
How long is one day on Mercury?,One day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days – that’s a very long school day!
How long is one year on Mercury?,A year on Mercury is only 88 Earth days because it zooms around the Sun so fast.
Does Mercury have an atmosphere?,It has a very thin layer of gas called an exosphere – it’s almost like having no air at all.
Why can’t people breathe on Mercury?,"There’s almost no oxygen and the air is way too thin, hot, and full of radiation."
What color is Mercury?,"Mercury looks gray and rocky, a bit like the Moon."
Who was Mercury named after?,It was named after the speedy messenger of the Roman gods because it moves so fast across the sky.
Can we see Mercury from Earth without a telescope?,Yes! It’s sometimes visible just after sunset or before sunrise – it’s called the “evening star” or “morning star.”
What spacecraft have visited Mercury?,Two spacecraft: Mariner 10 in the 1970s and MESSENGER from 2004–2015.
What did MESSENGER discover?,"It found ice in deep craters near the poles that never see sunlight, even though Mercury is super hot!"
Is there ice on Mercury?,"Yes, hidden in shadowy craters at the north and south poles where the Sun never shines."
Why doesn’t the ice melt on Mercury?,"Those craters are always in shadow and super cold, and there’s no air to carry heat to them."
How fast does Mercury travel around the Sun?,It zooms at about 47 kilometers per second (29 miles per second) – the fastest planet!
Does Mercury have rings like Saturn?,"No, Mercury has no rings at all."
What's the biggest crater on Mercury?,It’s the Caloris Basin – so huge you could fit the whole state of Texas inside it!
Why's Mercury’s sky black even in daytime?,"It has almost no atmosphere to scatter sunlight, so the sky stays black and you can see stars during the day."
Can people ever live on Mercury?,"Probably not – it’s too hot, too cold, no air, and too much radiation from the Sun."
How many times could Mercury fit inside Earth?,About 18 Mercurys could fit inside Earth.
What's Mercury mostly made of?,It has a huge iron core (almost 75% of the planet) covered by a thin rocky layer.
Why does Mercury have such a big iron core?,"Scientists think a giant crash long ago knocked away most of the rocky outside, leaving the heavy iron."
Is Mercury shrinking?,"Yes! It’s slowly cooling inside and shrinking a tiny bit, making wrinkle-like cliffs."
What are those wrinkle cliffs called?,They’re called “scarps” or “lobate scarps.”
How long would it take to drive around Mercury in a car?,"If you drove 100 km/h without stopping, it would take about 60 Earth days to go all the way around."
Can you explain why Mercury has no seasons?,"Actually, Mercury has almost no tilt, so it doesn’t really have seasons like Earth."

What's a transit of Mercury?,When Mercury passes directly between Earth and the Sun – it looks like a tiny black dot crossing the Sun.
How often do we study Mercury today?,Scientists use telescopes on Earth and data from the old MESSENGER mission.
Will we send another spacecraft to Mercury?,Yes! A mission called BepiColombo (from Europe and Japan) is on its way and will arrive in 2025–2026.
What's special about Mercury’s orbit?,It’s the most oval (elliptical) orbit of any planet except Pluto.
Why's it hard to send spacecraft to Mercury?,"The Sun’s gravity is so strong that spacecraft have to slow down a lot, which takes many fly-bys."
How many Earth days equal one Mercury day at the equator?,"Because of the slow spin, one full day-night cycle is 176 Earth days."
Is Mercury a rocky planet or a gas planet?,"Mercury is a rocky (terrestrial) planet, like Earth, Venus, and Mars."
What would happen if you dropped a feather and a hammer on Mercury?,They would hit the ground at the same time (just like on the Moon) because there’s almost no air.
What's Mercury?,Mercury is the smallest planet in our Solar System and the closest planet to the Sun.
How far is Mercury from the Sun?,Mercury is about 58 million kilometers (36 million miles) from the Sun on average – much closer than Earth!
Why's Mercury the closest planet to the Sun?,It formed that way billions of years ago when the Solar System was born – it just happened to be the nearest one.
How big is Mercury compared to Earth?,"Mercury is much smaller – if Earth were the size of a basketball, Mercury would be like a tennis ball."
Does Mercury have any moons?,"No, Mercury has zero moons."
What's the surface of Mercury like?,"It’s rocky, gray, and covered in thousands of craters from asteroid hits, just like our Moon."
Why does Mercury have so many craters?,"It has almost no air or atmosphere to burn up space rocks, so they crash right into it."
How hot does Mercury get during the day?,It can reach over 400°C (800°F) – hotter than an oven!
Why's Mercury so hot?,It’s very close to the Sun and the sunlight is super strong there.
How cold does Mercury get at night?,It can drop to -170°C (-280°F) – colder than a freezer!
Why does Mercury get so cold at night?,"It has almost no atmosphere to trap the heat, so all the warmth escapes into space."
How long is one day on Mercury?,One day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days – that’s a very long school day!
How long is one year on Mercury?,A year on Mercury is only 88 Earth days because it zooms around the Sun so fast.
Does Mercury have an atmosphere?,It has a very thin layer of gas called an exosphere – it’s almost like having no air at all.
Why can’t people breathe on Mercury?,"There’s almost no oxygen and the air is way too thin, hot, and full of radiation."
What color is Mercury?,"Mercury looks gray and rocky, a bit like the Moon."
Who was Mercury named after?,It was named after the speedy messenger of the Roman gods because it moves so fast across the sky.
Can we see Mercury from Earth without a telescope?,Yes! It’s sometimes visible just after sunset or before sunrise – it’s called the “evening star” or “morning star.”
What spacecraft have visited Mercury?,Two spacecraft: Mariner 10 in the 1970s and MESSENGER from 2004–2015.
What did MESSENGER discover?,"It found ice in deep craters near the poles that never see sunlight, even though Mercury is super hot!"
Is there ice on Mercury?,"Yes, hidden in shadowy craters at the north and south poles where the Sun never shines."
Why doesn’t the ice melt on Mercury?,"Those craters are always in shadow and super cold, and there’s no air to carry heat to them."
How fast does Mercury travel around the Sun?,It zooms at about 47 kilometers per second (29 miles per second) – the fastest planet!
Does Mercury have rings like Saturn?,"No, Mercury has no rings at all."
What's the biggest crater on Mercury?,It’s the Caloris Basin – so huge you could fit the whole state of Texas inside it!
Why's Mercury’s sky black even in daytime?,"It has almost no atmosphere to scatter sunlight, so the sky stays black and you can see stars during the day."
Can people ever live on Mercury?,"Probably not – it’s too hot, too cold, no air, and too much radiation from the Sun."
How many times could Mercury fit inside Earth?,About 18 Mercurys could fit inside Earth.
What's Mercury mostly made of?,It has a huge iron core (almost 75% of the planet) covered by a thin rocky layer.
Why does Mercury have such a big iron core?,"Scientists think a giant crash long ago knocked away most of the rocky outside, leaving the heavy iron."
Is Mercury shrinking?,"Yes! It’s slowly cooling inside and shrinking a tiny bit, making wrinkle-like cliffs."
What are those wrinkle cliffs called?,They’re called “scarps” or “lobate scarps.”
How long would it take to drive around Mercury in a car?,"If you drove 100 km/h without stopping, it would take about 60 Earth days to go all the way around."
Can you explain why Mercury has no seasons?,"Actually, Mercury has almost no tilt, so it doesn’t really have seasons like Earth."
Where's the hottest place on Mercury?,Right at the point facing the Sun at noon – it can get hotter than 430°C!
Where's the coldest place on Mercury?,In the bottoms of polar craters that never see sunlight.
Why does the Sun look bigger from Mercury?,"Because Mercury is closer to the Sun, the Sun appears almost three times bigger than from Earth."
What's Mercury’s gravity like compared to Earth?,It’s only about 38% of Earth’s gravity – you would weigh much less and could jump really high!
How many people have walked on Mercury?,Zero – no human has ever been there; only robots!
What's the brightest planet we see from Earth?,"Venus is usually brighter, but Mercury can look very bright when conditions are right."
Can you see Mercury during the day?,Very rarely and only with a telescope because the Sun is too bright.

Is Venus bigger or smaller than Earth?,Venus is almost the same size as Earth – it’s like Earth’s twin sister!
Why do we call Venus Earth’s twin?,"Because it’s almost the same size and made of rock, but it’s way too hot to live on."
How far is Venus from the Sun?,Venus is about 108 million kilometers (67 million miles) from the Sun.
How hot is Venus?,It’s over 460°C (860°F) all the time – hot enough to melt lead!
Why's Venus the hottest planet?,It has a super thick blanket of carbon dioxide gas that traps heat like a giant greenhouse.
What's the greenhouse effect on Venus?,"The thick atmosphere traps the Sun’s heat so it can’t escape, making the planet super toasty."
Does Venus have any moons?,"No, Venus has zero moons."
How long is one day on Venus?,One day on Venus (sunrise to sunrise) lasts 243 Earth days – longer than its year!
How long is a year on Venus?,A year on Venus is 225 Earth days – shorter than on Earth.
Why does Venus spin backwards?,Venus spins the opposite way from most planets – on Venus the Sun rises in the west!
What color is Venus in the sky?,Venus is bright white-yellow and is the brightest thing in the sky after the Sun and Moon.
Why's Venus so bright from Earth?,"It’s covered in thick white clouds that reflect sunlight really well, and it comes quite close to Earth."
Can we see Venus without a telescope?,Yes! It’s often called the Evening Star or Morning Star because it shines so brightly.
What are the clouds on Venus made of?,"They’re made of sulfuric acid – like nasty, poisonous rain that never reaches the ground."
Does it rain on Venus?,"Yes, but the rain is sulfuric acid and it evaporates before hitting the ground."
What's the surface of Venus like?,"It’s rocky with thousands of volcanoes, huge lava plains, and mountains."
Are there active volcanoes on Venus?,Scientists think some might still be active – Venus is a very volcanic world!
How thick is Venus’s atmosphere?,It’s about 90 times thicker than Earth’s – it would crush you like the bottom of the ocean.
Can humans breathe on Venus?,No way! The air is mostly carbon dioxide and full of poisonous gases.
Who was Venus named after?,Venus was named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty because it looks so pretty in the sky.
How many spacecraft have landed on Venus?,Only Soviet spacecraft have landed – the Venera probes – and they melted quickly!
How long did the longest Venus lander survive?,The record is about 2 hours before the heat and pressure destroyed it.
Is there lightning on Venus?,Yes! Scientists have seen huge lightning storms in the thick clouds.
Why does Venus have almost no water?,The extreme heat long ago boiled all the water away into space.
Does Venus have craters?,Not many – lava from volcanoes covered most old craters.
What's the highest mountain on Venus?,Maxwell Montes – it’s taller than Mount Everest!
How strong is the wind on Venus?,"Near the ground it’s slow, but high in the clouds it blows over 350 km/h – faster than a hurricane!"
What's super-rotation on Venus?,The clouds go all the way around the planet in just 4 Earth days even though the planet spins slowly.
Is there ice on Venus?,No – it’s far too hot everywhere for ice.
What's Venus’s sky color if you stood there?,It would look orange-yellow because of the thick clouds.
Can people ever live on Venus?,"Not on the ground, but some scientists dream about floating cities high in the cooler clouds."
How much would you weigh on Venus?,Almost the same as on Earth because it’s nearly the same size and gravity.
What's a transit of Venus?,When Venus passes directly between Earth and the Sun – it looks like a small black dot on the Sun.
How often does a transit of Venus happen?,"Very rarely – they come in pairs 8 years apart, then wait over 100 years."
Does Venus have seasons?,"No, because it has almost no tilt – every day is the same."
Where's the pressure highest on Venus?,On the surface – it’s like being 900 meters under the ocean on Earth.
Why can’t we see the surface of Venus with normal telescopes?,The thick clouds hide everything – we need radar to see through them.
What spacecraft mapped Venus with radar?,The Magellan spacecraft in the 1990s made the best maps of the hidden surface.
Is Venus getting hotter or cooler?,It’s stayed about the same super-hot temperature for billions of years.
What's the Soviet Venera program?,A series of brave Russian probes that took the only photos ever from Venus’s surface.
Can you see stars from Venus during the day?,No – the thick clouds make the sky bright all the time.
Why does Venus shine so long in the evening?,"It follows the Sun down or comes up before the Sun, so we can see it for hours."
Does Venus have earthquakes?,They’re called venusquakes – the ground sometimes shakes from shrinking or volcanoes.

What's Venus?,Venus is the second planet from the Sun and the hottest planet in our Solar System.
Is Venus bigger or smaller than Earth?,Venus is almost the same size as Earth – it’s like Earth’s twin sister!
Why do we call Venus Earth’s twin?,"Because it’s almost the same size and made of rock, but it’s way too hot to live on."
How far is Venus from the Sun?,Venus is about 108 million kilometers (67 million miles) from the Sun.
How hot is Venus?,It’s over 460°C (860°F) all the time – hot enough to melt lead!
Why's Venus the hottest planet?,It has a super thick blanket of carbon dioxide gas that traps heat like a giant greenhouse.
What's the greenhouse effect on Venus?,"The thick atmosphere traps the Sun’s heat so it can’t escape, making the planet super toasty."
Does Venus have any moons?,"No, Venus has zero moons."
How long is one day on Venus?,One day on Venus (sunrise to sunrise) lasts 243 Earth days – longer than its year!
How long is a year on Venus?,A year on Venus is 225 Earth days – shorter than on Earth.
Why does Venus spin backwards?,Venus spins the opposite way from most planets – on Venus the Sun rises in the west!
What color is Venus in the sky?,Venus is bright white-yellow and is the brightest thing in the sky after the Sun and Moon.
Why's Venus so bright from Earth?,"It’s covered in thick white clouds that reflect sunlight really well, and it comes quite close to Earth."
Can we see Venus without a telescope?,Yes! It’s often called the Evening Star or Morning Star because it shines so brightly.
What are the clouds on Venus made of?,"They’re made of sulfuric acid – like nasty, poisonous rain that never reaches the ground."
Does it rain on Venus?,"Yes, but the rain is sulfuric acid and it evaporates before hitting the ground."
What's the surface of Venus like?,"It’s rocky with thousands of volcanoes, huge lava plains, and mountains."
Are there active volcanoes on Venus?,Scientists think some might still be active – Venus is a very volcanic world!
How thick is Venus’s atmosphere?,It’s about 90 times thicker than Earth’s – it would crush you like the bottom of the ocean.
Can humans breathe on Venus?,No way! The air is mostly carbon dioxide and full of poisonous gases.
Who was Venus named after?,Venus was named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty because it looks so pretty in the sky.
How many spacecraft have landed on Venus?,Only Soviet spacecraft have landed – the Venera probes – and they melted quickly!
How long did the longest Venus lander survive?,The record is about 2 hours before the heat and pressure destroyed it.
Is there lightning on Venus?,Yes! Scientists have seen huge lightning storms in the thick clouds.
Why does Venus have almost no water?,The extreme heat long ago boiled all the water away into space.
Does Venus have craters?,Not many – lava from volcanoes covered most old craters.
What's the highest mountain on Venus?,Maxwell Montes – it’s taller than Mount Everest!
How strong is the wind on Venus?,"Near the ground it’s slow, but high in the clouds it blows over 350 km/h – faster than a hurricane!"
What's super-rotation on Venus?,The clouds go all the way around the planet in just 4 Earth days even though the planet spins slowly.
Is there ice on Venus?,No – it’s far too hot everywhere for ice.
What's Venus’s sky color if you stood there?,It would look orange-yellow because of the thick clouds.
Can people ever live on Venus?,"Not on the ground, but some scientists dream about floating cities high in the cooler clouds."
How much would you weigh on Venus?,Almost the same as on Earth because it’s nearly the same size and gravity.
What's a transit of Venus?,When Venus passes directly between Earth and the Sun – it looks like a small black dot on the Sun.
How often does a transit of Venus happen?,"Very rarely – they come in pairs 8 years apart, then wait over 100 years."
Does Venus have seasons?,"No, because it has almost no tilt – every day is the same."
Where's the pressure highest on Venus?,On the surface – it’s like being 900 meters under the ocean on Earth.
Why can’t we see the surface of Venus with normal telescopes?,The thick clouds hide everything – we need radar to see through them.
What spacecraft mapped Venus with radar?,The Magellan spacecraft in the 1990s made the best maps of the hidden surface.
Is Venus getting hotter or cooler?,It’s stayed about the same super-hot temperature for billions of years.
What's the Soviet Venera program?,A series of brave Russian probes that took the only photos ever from Venus’s surface.
Can you see stars from Venus during the day?,No – the thick clouds make the sky bright all the time.
Why does Venus shine so long in the evening?,"It follows the Sun down or comes up before the Sun, so we can see it for hours."
Does Venus have earthquakes?,They’re called venusquakes – the ground sometimes shakes from shrinking or volcanoes.
How many volcanoes are on Venus?,"Over 1,600 big ones have been counted, and probably millions of small ones!"
Is Venus a rocky planet?,"Yes, it’s a rocky terrestrial planet just like Earth, Mercury, and Mars."
What would happen if you took off your spacesuit on Venus?,"You’d be crushed, burned, and poisoned all at once in seconds!"
Will we go back to Venus soon?,Yes! NASA and Europe are planning new missions like VERITAS and EnVision for the 2030s.
What's special about Venus’s day being longer than its year?,It’s the only planet where a day lasts longer than a year – very strange!
Why's Venus sometimes called Earth’s evil twin?,Because it’s almost the same size but turned into a deadly hot hell instead of a nice home.

What is the Gravity on Saturn?,The gravity at its cloud tops is similar to Earth's (about 1.07g). Its low density makes the pull surprisingly close to ours.
Does Saturn have craters?,"No, Saturn has no solid surface for craters. Its moons, however, are covered in them."
Does Saturn have clouds?,"Yes, Saturn has cloud bands, though they are fainter than Jupiter's. It also has occasional giant storms."
Does Saturn have water?,There is water ice in its famous rings and in the atmospheres of some of its moons. The moon Enceladus shoots out water geysers.
How old is Saturn?,"Saturn formed about 4.6 billion years ago, around the same time as the Sun and the other planets."
Can you see Saturn from Earth?,"Yes, Saturn is visible to the naked eye as a bright, yellowish 'star'. Through a small telescope, you can see its amazing rings."
What colour is Uranus?,"Uranus has a pale, cyan or blue-green colour, caused by methane gas in its atmosphere absorbing red light."
How hot is Uranus?,"Uranus is the coldest planet, with cloud-top temperatures dropping to a frigid -224°C (-371°F)."
What does Uranus look like?,"Uranus is a featureless, pale blue-green marble. It rotates on its side, so it looks like a rolling ball as it orbits."
What is the surface of Uranus like?,"Uranus is an ice giant with no solid surface. Beneath its atmosphere is a slushy mantle of water, ammonia, and methane ices."
How long would it take to get to Uranus?,"Only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, has visited Uranus. It took about 8.5 years to get there from Earth."
How big is Uranus?,Uranus is the third-largest planet by diameter. It's about four times wider than Earth.
How far from Earth is Uranus?,"At its closest, Uranus is about 2.6 billion km (1.6 billion miles) from Earth."
How far from the Sun is Uranus?,"Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, orbiting at an average distance of about 2.9 billion km (1.8 billion miles)."
How heavy is Uranus?,Uranus has a mass about 14.5 times that of Earth. It is much less massive than Jupiter and Saturn.
Does Uranus have Moons?,"Yes, Uranus has at least 28 known moons, all named after characters from Shakespeare and Alexander Pope."
Does Uranus have rings?,"Yes, Uranus has 13 known faint, dark rings. They are made of very dark material, likely radiation-processed organics."
Does Uranus have an atmosphere?,"Yes, its atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, with a significant amount of methane that gives it its blue colour."
What is the Gravity on Uranus?,The gravity at its cloud tops is about 89% of Earth's. A 100 lb person would feel like 89 lbs there.
Does Uranus have craters?,"No, Uranus has no solid surface for craters to form on. Its moons, like Miranda, have dramatic, cratered landscapes."
Does Uranus have clouds?,"Yes, but they are very faint and hard to see. Recent observations have revealed occasional bright cloud features."
Does Uranus have water?,"Deep below its atmosphere, scientists believe there is a vast, super-heated 'ocean' of water and other ices surrounding its core."
How old is Uranus?,Uranus is about 4.6 billion years old.
Can you see Uranus from Earth?,"Yes, but just barely. It's at the edge of naked-eye visibility and appears as a very faint, blue-green star. You need binoculars or a telescope to see it clearly."
What colour is Neptune?,"Neptune is a vivid, deep azure blue, even richer in colour than Uranus due to more active atmospheric chemistry."
How hot is Neptune?,"Despite being far from the Sun, Neptune's cloud tops are about -214°C (-353°F). Surprisingly, it's warmer than Uranus."
What does Neptune look like?,"Neptune is a deep blue planet with dynamic, visible white clouds and occasional giant dark storms, like the Great Dark Spot."
What is the surface of Neptune like?,"Neptune is an ice giant with no solid surface. It has a thick atmosphere over a deep, hot, slushy mantle of water, ammonia, and methane ices."
How long would it take to get to Neptune?,Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to visit Neptune. Its journey took about 12 years to reach the planet.
How big is Neptune?,Neptune is slightly smaller than Uranus but more massive. It's the fourth-largest planet by diameter.
How far from Earth is Neptune?,"At its closest, Neptune is a staggering 4.3 billion km (2.7 billion miles) from Earth."
How far from the Sun is Neptune?,"Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, orbiting at an average distance of about 4.5 billion km (2.8 billion miles)."
How heavy is Neptune?,Neptune has a mass about 17 times that of Earth.
Does Neptune have Moons?,"Yes, Neptune has at least 16 known moons. Its largest, Triton, is geologically active and orbits backwards."
Does Neptune have rings?,"Yes, Neptune has five main faint, dusty rings. They are dark and hard to see, but they are there."
Does Neptune have an atmosphere?,"Yes, its atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium with methane, and it has the strongest winds in the solar system—over 2,000 km/h!"
What is the Gravity on Neptune?,The gravity at its cloud tops is about 1.14 times Earth's. A 100 lb person would feel like 114 lbs there.
Does Neptune have craters?,"No, Neptune has no solid surface for craters. Any impactor would be swallowed by the planet's dense, fluid interior."
Does Neptune have clouds?,"Yes, Neptune has very active and visible cloud features, including high-altitude methane ice clouds that streak across its blue atmosphere."
Does Neptune have water?,"Like Uranus, scientists believe Neptune has a deep, hot, dense 'ocean' of water and other ices surrounding its small, rocky core."
How old is Neptune?,Neptune is about 4.6 billion years old.
Can you see Neptune from Earth?,"No, you cannot see Neptune with the naked eye. You need a powerful telescope to see it as a tiny blue disc."
